                        This release focuses on two major new features - a

                    <ul>

                        <li> New annotations view to see all your annotations in one place.</li>

                        <li> New sidebar to expand contract to show other pages within polar</li>

                        <li>  New option to create a pagemark at the mouse point.  Still more work to make
                            the key bindings visible.</li>

                        <li>  Adding forced CSS for ::selection so that sites that have broken CSS for
                        highlighting don't actually break polar and we also have consistent highlight
                            support.</li>

                        <li>  Fixed some navigational issues in the web capture system.</li>

                        <li>  Fixed bug the annotation bar in PDF where resize will kill it.  Hopefully the
                            last bug there.</li>

                        <li>  Backend changes to support cloze deletions in Anki.</li>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Polar 1.1 is fresh out the door and a lot of amazing features and
                        bug fixes are enabled in this release.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The biggest feature by far is our support for
                        the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-polar/jkfdkjomocoaljglgddnmhcbolldcafd">'Save to Polar' chrome extension</a> that
                        allows you to send the URL of your active tab to Polar
                        for content capture.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This makes it a lot easier to work with Polar as you can
                        just click a button in Chrome and have it sent to Polar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We plan on adding support for Safari, and Firefox in the
                        future but we're taking things one step at a time.
                    </p>

                    </p>

                    <h3>Other features in 1.1 include:</h3>

                    <li>
                        Disabling amp for now until we have a better solution on how to show the user
                        that an AMP page is displayed and how to disable / enable it.  Otherwise its
                        confusing and often the amp page is WORSE not better.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Fixed bugs with the browser size not changing during capture browser changing
                        and also fixed some issues with it not properly accepting the browser change
                        in some situations.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Fixed bug in HTML zoom where the page would be truncated improperly.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Blocked amp ads during the capture but they aren't blocked during the preview
                        at the moment.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        "Fixed" nasty anti-aliasing bug in electron by blocking amp ads. They were
                        annoying anyway but for some reason they were breaking chrome rendering -
                        probably due to some web component nonsense.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Implemented a new strategy with the vertical height algorithm in the capture
                        system to revert it back to auto instead of a fixed max-height.  Works a lot
                        better now.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Date/times no longer include ' ago' to be a bit more concise.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Added small FAQ entry to enable Anki sync.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Fixed a bug where we could select text and not properly work with elements.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Renderer analytics didn't understand that a callback without an error wasn't
                        a failure.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Upgraded a number of important react packages:
                        react react-dom react-moment react-select @types/react-table
                        @types/react-select @types/react @types/prop-types @types/node-fetch
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        removed inversify package (were not using it)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        latest fontawesome
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        latest node-fetch
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        fixed issue with electron-builder where it was forcing us to upgrade to the
                        latest version for each release.
