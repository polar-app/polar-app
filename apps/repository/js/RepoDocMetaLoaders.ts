        // and I don't want latency in the UI.  It might be better to batch into
        // 50 items each when SENDING the events and not throttling the events
        // but throttling the actual snapshot rate.  For example, if we receive
        // a snapshot with 500 items we can just break that into say 50 items
        // each and then immediately update the UI with no trailing latency at
        // the end.  But we can throttle the actual number of snapshots so that
        // if we receive tons of snapshots with 1 item them we batch these but
        // even THEN that would add latency because we're not sure how often
        // the server is sending data.

        // TODO: consider ALWAYS sending the last event as soon as we get it
        // and clear the throttler.  This way if we receive the 100% event we
        // don't have any latency.  We're goign to need a clear() or flush()
        // method in the throttler. maybe just a force arg to exec() to force
        // this method from being called.  We might want to have a minTimeout
        // here too so that this flush behavior couldn't be triggered too often
        // but maybe we're overthinking here (for now).
