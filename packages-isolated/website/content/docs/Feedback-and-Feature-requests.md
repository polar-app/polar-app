# Feedback and feature requests

There are two main ways to provide feedback – either by video or through our 2-question survey. You can find both in the ```?``` button on the bottom right.

If you encounter bugs, it’s best to leave a video with the bug recoding. Please note, the video feedback feature only works in the webapp, not in the desktop apps.

For feature requests, please use the short survey. Please be as specific as possible in the survey.
