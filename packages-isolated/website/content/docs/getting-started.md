Your starting point in Polar is the document library. Here you can organize all your PDFs, EPUBs and webpages in one place, organize and work with them.

Files can be uploaded by dragging them into the window or using the `Add document` button at the top left.

## Annotation Viewer:

When reading your documents with Polar you can create highlights, comment on highlights, (text & area highlights), annotate them, and manage them using the annotation viewer. The annotation viewer captures your highlights and annotations from all files in one place.

You can find your daily notes in the left sidebar, click on the calendar symbol underneath your statistics and your note for the day will be created automatically. 

This is typically the space to capture your daily thoughts, as you can link all notes to their relevant pages

## Creating Flashcards (Manual):

You can easily create flashcards by clicking the flash icon in the toolbar of an annotation. Your annotation will automatically be used as the back (answer) of the flashcard with the front empty for you to fill out. You can edit both sides of the card.

## Creating Flashcards (AI):

You can also automatically create flashcards using AI, by clicking the flash icon with the A.

## Flashcard review:

You can review all flashcards and annotations that you have created in Polar in the annotation viewer. Polar supports spaced repetition that automatically schedules reviews based on how well you know a card.

If you're not familiar with spaced repetition you can ready up on it
