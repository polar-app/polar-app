When you capture a web page with the Chrome extension, a snapshot is saved in your repository. Please note, this means that if the website is updated or deleted in the future, those changes will not be reflected in your captured version.

During the capture process, we fetch the full HTML including iframes, and store them in
a portable PHZ file that can be used for long term archival of web content.

Additionally, we capture the document in a way to make them more usable and more 
readable. This is achieved using Mozilla's Readability.

That is it, the web content is now saved in your document library.

Select text on any web page and use the Chrome extension to only import the selection instead of the entire page.
