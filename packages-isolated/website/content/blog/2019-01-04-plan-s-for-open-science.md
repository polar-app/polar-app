# The EU Plan S for Open Access to Scientific Research 

The EU and China <a
href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/will-world-embrace-plan-s-radical-proposal-mandate-open-access-science-papers">have
an ambitious new plan</a> to provide open access (OA) for scientific papers:

> Since the September 2018 launch of the Europe-backed program to mandate
immediate open access (OA) to scientific literature, 16 funders in 13 countries
have signed on. That's still far shy of Plan S's ambition: to convince the
world's major research funders to require immediate OA to all published papers
stemming from their grants. Whether it will reach that goal depends in part on
details that remain to be settled, including a cap on the author charges that
funders will pay for OA publication. But the plan has gained momentum: In
December 2018, China stunned many by expressing strong support for Plan S.
             
What I'm most excited about here is the implication it could have for content
aggregation, open data, and open publication platforms like Polar.

First, research could be easily accessed which means obtaining a copy of the PDF
is as easy as clicking a link.

Second, there are a lot of collaborative features that could be enabled here 
including document clustering, content recommendation, collaborative filtering, 
etc.

I'm hopeful the closed science community suffers a heavy loss here as science and
closed access are inherently incompatible.
