<i>Sorry about the transcript formatting. I'm going to have to figure out a
better long term solution here.</i>

I wanted to discuss what was going into polar 1.8 which we just shipped (I think
a couple days ago( and there's some really cool features in here and unfortunately
I didn't get a chance to create this video when we cut the release so I'm
probably gonna do a 1.8.1 which includes this video but there's a few
other small features so a lot of really cool stuff went into this release I
think one of the most usable features was better PDF import from the web so you
know this is the polar button and one of the things we did recently is we I
public I computed the top 500 PDFs on hacker news for 2018 I also do this for
polar but with a new version of polar you can really easily import these so
let's just say this competitive programmers handbook that will then load up into
the browser and then we can just click this which will then get saved into polar
the download started it gets kicked off and gets automatically imported and
there we go and worked perfectly that was a great tip oh it's amazing when you
actually did a demo something and it actually works anyway it should be you know
it becomes part of your repository after at that point so and then it's uh it's
just you know another one of the documents that you can use so another feature
that we added is let's see here this is a document that I was editing recently
we added support for rich text annotations so I'm just gonna clear that page
mark and just this is just an example but if you go and you create a highlight
and you go to add a comment now at the top you get these formatting options now
before actually this field here was rich text and you could you know put images
and stuff in here and it will just work but uh some people didn't couldn't just
they didn't realize and so they're asking for the feature of full HTML and so I
changed that to make this a little bit more obvious that's actually related to
this next feature which is closed deletions for flash cards so you can go over
here now and so this is a front and back card which is at fault and you can just
change this to close a few is close you create a little flash card with this is
closed you can either click this button and it'll make that a closed deletion or
you can just come up here and do you can just do something like this ctrl C I
think it's yeah shift ctrl C will do that for you and you just run it by the
keyboards the same keyboard that Anki uses so either either way work I'm not
gonna create that flash card so you know closed lesions were something that
users really wanted they're really asking for that so I'm glad we've got that
got that in there for you so the other really nice feature is stats view so if
you come into stats it shows you some just in some initial stats we're planning
on expanding on this one of the things that I want to add is reading like the
pages read per day so that way you can actually track how you know you're
reading over time and then I want to implement the streak functionality so like
if you've been reading for five days ten days in a row so then we'll just show a
big five up here and then you can keep him you know for me it's actually
encourages me to to keep reading what I know when I actually have quantifiable
data behind it so this is gonna be expanded but right now we just have some
initial stats if there's a stats that you guys think would be valuable around
your reading and they're easy to implement just let me know and I'll just go and
do it then we also have a logs view which is nice so the logs view is used so
that way we can actually understand what is happening in the background so if
you have a bug or a problem this actually is the exact same log that is
displayed in the JavaScript console so now what you can do is if there's any
issue you can just copy it to clipboard we wrote the role text to the clipboard
then you just paste it into a bug report for me so that way I can fix it easily
that's really helpful for when you guys report a bug and I don't really have
access to your machine you can just send me the logs so another really cool
feature is this option right here you go to tags we now have support for related
tags so let's see I think this one will work that's really interesting do this
one growth there we go really two tags so the other excuse me the other posts
didn't have enough data to show related tags but I often talk about startups and
she's me read a lot of documents about growth and growing companies early on and
trying to grow products and get an initial user base and so that really helps me
because I can also add it reminds me to add these secondary tags and the more
data you put into polar the better gets to compute the related tags so
essentially the way it works is that it uses the tags you have and builds a
collaborative index of you know Co Co similarity basically so it's saying like
okay the documents of this like this also have this tag so very very handy I I'm
really excited we got that in and then the last feature is over here there's
some more options for working with the file so that's back and so back in the
PDF so if you need to get the path of the file you can just copy it and it'll
copy to the clipboard you can also show file which will bring up the finder the
problem on Linux unfortunately can bring up the directory but he can't bring up
the file but on Windows and Mac should work fine but I'm demoing on my limited
machine and I think those are the main features that went into this release in
the next version of polar is gonna have a bunch of stuff but I actually might
also release an earlier version just to fix a few small a few small bugs that
sort of crept in and as usual if you guys are loving polar and you guys are
liking it please feel free to make a donation we still can't afford a continuous
to integration server for polar which is really unfortunate because it wastes a
lot of my time but uh you know please feel free to donate if you'd like to know
where to donate you can go to this community tab and you can donate right here
click to just click this link and it will open up the open collected page where
you can download it and we made up $270 and I still hurt in there so if you guys
could help me out there let me know also if you can if you can get your company
to do it that'd be great because you know it's it's a tax benefit for them and
usually as part of your employment they let you donate some amount of money so
uh thanks thanks a lot and please give us some feedback on how your liking
Polar.
