# Overview

- use react-i18n-next

- how do we do the translation with localize?  I want to define all my strings
  and then have them automatically dump new strings.
  
- it seems I can do inline translations without having to use dedicated/external fiels

# New API

Don't use their API directly as it's a big ugly.   

## Hooks

- use a look like


```typescript

const {welcome} = useIntl();

```

## Components

```typescript jsx

<Intl name='welcome'/>

```
