These are 'external' package that we don't won't on directly but that we've forked with small changes we need 
to work with Polar. Ideally we'd get our chanages accepted upstream but often maintainers take forever to 
apply PRs.

Additionally, some of the changes we've made MAY NOT be accepted and maintaining a fork with a small number 
of changes isn't too difficult.

We give these a special version number and push to our NPM repository.
