# Remove duplicate typings from the original pdfjs-dist package because
# we modified the library at some point (due to bugs) and the typings for it
# we handle through a dedicated package (called @polar/pdfjs-dist-types)
# which handles the changed types, but the existence of both is problematic
# during a "yarn run compile" for some packages, most notably:
# packages/polar-app-public/polar-pdf/package.json
# because those packages prioritize the original typings (the ones included
# in the "pdfjs-dist" package instead of the ones from @polar/pdfjs-dist-types
pdfjs-dist/types
