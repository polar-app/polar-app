- Export settings
    - 10 fps ... 
    - Do not encode audo

<audio> element must be muted
- set the frame rate MUCH lower.. we don't heed 60fps... 10-15 is totally fine.

# TODO

- we don't need the full screen recorded actually... 

- Figure out how to hide the cursor in Camtasia... 

- The MAX size we show videos is 1280 so for HiDPI displays we only need to show
  2560 (1280x2) since anything larger won't be shown.
  
- Play with just capturing it at 1280 on my hidpi display...
