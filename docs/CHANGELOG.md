  are about to ship.

- Support for our new chrome extension.

- Disabling amp for now until we have a better solution on how to show the user
  that an AMP page is displayed and how to disable / enable it.  Otherwise its
  confusing and often the amp page is WORSE not better.

- Fixed bugs with the browser size not changing during capture browser changing
  and also fixed some issues with it not properly accepting the browser change 
  in some situations.  

- Fixed bug in HTML zoom where the page would be truncated improperly.

- Blocked amp ads during the capture but they aren't blocked during the preview 
  at the moment.

- "Fixed" nasty anti-aliasing bug in electron by blocking amp ads. They were 
  annoying anyway but for some reason they were breaking chrome rendering - 
  probably due to some web component nonsense.   

- Implemented a new strategy with the vertical height algorithm in the capture 
  system to revert it back to auto instead of a fixed max-height.  Works a lot
  better now.  

- Date/times no longer include ' ago' to be a bit more concise.

- Basic initial version of AppPath which can be used to load apps via HTTP now.

- Fixed a bug where we could select text and not properly work with elements.

- Renderer analytics didn't understand that a callback without an error wasn't 
  a failure.

    react react-dom react-moment react-select @types/react-table 
    @types/react-select @types/react @types/prop-types @types/node-fetch

# 1.0.12

- Reduced the minimum mouse click duration required for bringing up the annotation 
  bar.

# 1.0.11

- release to fix MacOS certificate bugs

# 1.0.10

- banner message about opencollective donations

- Change capture key binding to CommandOrControl+N (new).  The other key binding 
  conflicted with window management in Chrome and we might want to use those
  key bindings in the future.

- STASH files can be added directly as a backend file just like images and video
  which means that they could work with the future firebase store.  

- refactored the way we're handling popups for the annotation bar.  I think this
  will resolve most of the issues we're having but there are still a few more 
  glitches to be fixed.  

- If any of the input tags were invalid, they were ALL ignored.  Which is bad.

- Fixed ugly bug where percentags can be > 100% but only slightly.

- reworked the preview browser so that buttons are only enabled after you first
  load a URL so that it's not confusing for the user.

# 1.0.9

- release to fix MacOS release breakage.

# 1.0.8

- ability to enable fetching the auto-update from a pre-release

- the capture preview now expands the content once it's loaded.  One issue here 
  is that some documents appear too long.  I think it is an issue with computing
  the scroll height reliably and I'm still figuring this part out. 

- when capture preview is running we now set a title

# 1.0.7

- another release to fix Windows by upgrading sentinel

# 1.0.6

- changes to analytics and a rapid release for fixing Windows. 


# 1.0.5

    - menu for text-annotation to create flashcard + comment

- Capture now has a key binding: CommandOrControl+Shift+W

- Text highlights no longer being saved to JSON.. migrating them to the file 
  repo...

# 1.0.4

- Tags are stored with anki notes now.  They weren't before but they're critical
  to making our anki support work better. 

- We now have a basic but imperfect settings systems that allows us to persist
  various changes locally .. Will need to be refactored a bit in the future to
  make it more MVC and to work better with react.

- nr of annotations column to show / highlight documents which are annotated
  most.

- tags column which isn't enabled by default.

- improve double click handling to make sure we have a set of isolated single 
  click columns.

- merged PR from xuebingli to handle double click on columns intended to be 
  single click. 

    https://github.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/pull/303

- Fixed a bug where some pages weren't properly expanding when they were first
  loaded. 

- Fixed GA tracking of events which weren't sending before. Need this to 
  determine which features are being used.   

- Ability to click on the pulldown in the document repository to the right and 
  copy the URL for a document that was captured.

- Fixed bug where capture wouldn't generate a completely unique URL for storage
  on the file system and if you captured two URLs with the same title the 
  later one would update the former one.  We now include the a hash prefix of
  the SHA384 in the filename for uniqueness.

# 1.0.3

- Put ToS, cookie policy, and privacy policy in the about links so that people
  can get access to these easily.

- Super fast double click on text no longer brings up the annotation box.  Only
  more explicit highlights where the suer drags their mouse.

- Webaudio is enabled now. I had disabled it before as it's annoying when
  capture is running but we need it for video support to work properly.  

- PHZ files were not actually being compressed. Just stored.  Weird bug with 
  the API in jszip which made it easy to accidentally disable compression.  
  PHZ files will be 3x smaller in this release.    

- Upgraded to the latest sentry. I think there snap bug is related to sentry 
  but I'm not sure yet.  The snap packages weren't working but maybe they will
  in this release. 

- Upgraded to latest packages:
    - firebase
    - react
    - split.js
    - reactstrap

- Anki now properly uses the deck: tag when writing to decks.

- Initial support for Youtube video embeds.  We had NO support for youtube in 
  the past so even though this is minimal it's better than what we currently 
  have.

# 1.0.2

- The delete document prompt now has a subtitle to note that you will also lose
  the annotations.

- Border around the webview so you can see which part of the page is the doc.

- On OS X it's common to re-create a window in the app when the
  dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open. The way
  we handle this now is that if there are no windows open we re-create
  the document repository so they can select one. Otherwise we just
  re-focus the most recently used window.

- Deleting documents in the UI app repository is implemented.

- Deleting documents from the repository via API is implemented.

- Upgrade to latest reactstrap 

- Show the data dir path when loading help | about so that people can easily
  figure out where their data is being stored.

# 1.0.1

- This build should make manual auto-updates work. 

- Fixed a bug with some PDFs not opening properly

- Fixed bug with split.js by upgrading and also fixed some issues with rendering
  the page initially with split.js which caused it to re-snap and re-center
  itself.

# 1.0.0

- calling this version 1.0.0.  We are mostly feature complete.  There are a few
  things lacking but this way we can start getting more feedback as we're very 
  stable and people shouldn't assume the app is beta just becuase we're lacking
  a few features.

- Zip target was not provided for MacOS so auto-update was not working. 
  Hopefully it will in the next release.
  
- started adding the infra to add file attachments to the store 

# 1.0.0-beta211

  I need to take the time to build them correctly.  We have tar.
