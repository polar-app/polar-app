- prefer streams over 'for' loops
    - See ArrayStreams for usage and research Java streams

- prefer functional programming using interfaces and factories rather than
  classes and constructors

- Avoid 'any' and use types properly in Typescript

- All code should IDEALLY be tested
    - The exception is when React or Browser components prevent it but we should
      try for TDD 

- Use modern react hooks whenever possible

- maintain "cheat sheets" for other developers
