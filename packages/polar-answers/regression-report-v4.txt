The zodiacal constellations are different from the other constellations because they are not in the same place in the sky as the other constellations.  The zodiacal constellations are in the same place in the sky as the other constellations, but they are not in the same place in the sky as the constellations of the zodiac.  The constellations of the zodiac are in the same place in the sky as the constellations of the zodiac, but they are not in the same place in the sky as the constellations of the zodiac.

Objects continue to be at rest or move with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force.

Because the Earth is a sphere, the longitude of a point on the Earth's surface is the same as the latitude of that point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
astronomy Chapter 4 #2  unknown  0.0758  What are the main advantage and disadvantage of apparent solar time?                                                         The main advantage of apparent solar time is that it is easy to remember.  The main disadvantage is that it is not accurate.  The apparent solar time is the time that is measured by the Sun.  The actual solar time is the time that is measured by the Earth.  The difference between the two is called the equation of time.  The equation of time is the difference between the apparent solar time and the actual solar time.  The equation of time is the difference between the apparent solar time and the actual solar time.

The Moon’s cycle of phases is very regular, but the Moon’s orbit is not a perfect circle.

Because the Earth's orbit around the Sun is not a perfect circle, the Earth's orbit around the Sun is not a perfect circle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
astronomy Chapter 4 #7  unknown  0.0605  Why the year 1800 was not a leap year?                                                                                       Because of precession, the constellations of the zodiac slide westward along the ecliptic, going once around the sky in about 26,000 years.  Thus, today the real stars have slipped around by about 1/12 of the zodiac—about the width of one sign.  In most forms of astrology, however, the signs have remained assigned to the dates of the year they had when astrology was first set up.  This means that the astrological signs and the real constellations are out of step; the sign of Aries, for example, now occupies the
