astronomy Chapter 2 #6  fail     0.3333  Give at least one of Aristotle's arguments why he considered the earth to be round                                           Aristotle cited convincing arguments that Earth must be round.  First is the fact that as the Moon enters or emerges from Earth’s shadow during an eclipse of the Moon, the shape of the shadow seen on the Moon is always round (Figure 2.9).  Only a spherical object always produces a round shadow.  If Earth were a disk, for example, there would be some occasions when the sunlight would strike it edge-on and its shadow on the Moon would be a line. The more distant an object, the more nearly parallel the rays of light coming from it.  Of course, the Sun is not infinitely far away, but given its distance of 150 million kilometers, light rays striking Earth from a point on the Sun diverge from one another by an angle far too small to be observed with the unaided eye.  As a consequence, if people all over Earth who could see the Sun were to point at it, their fingers would appear to be at different distances from the Sun.  As a second argument, Aristotle explained that travelers who go south a significant distance are able to observe stars that are not visible farther north.  15.  How did Aristotle deduce that the Sun is farther away from Earth than the

The main advantage of apparent solar time is that it is easy to use.  It is based on the position of the Sun in the sky, and it is easy to tell what time it is by looking at the Sun.  The main disadvantage of apparent solar time is that it is not very accurate.  The length of an apparent solar day varies slightly during the year.  The length of a mean solar day is constant.  The length of a sidereal day is defined by the positions of the stars in the sky.  The length of a sidereal day is constant.

US history chap 2 #8    fail     1.3496  Why didn’t England make stronger attempts to colonize the New World before the late sixteenth to early seventeenth century?  England was a weak imperial power in the early seventeenth century.  It had only a few infant colonies in the Americas in the early 1600s.  The English never found treasure equal to that of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlán, and England did not quickly grow rich from its small American outposts.  The English colonies also differed from each other; Barbados and Virginia had a decidedly commercial orientation from the start, while the Puritan colonies of New England were intensely religious at their inception.  All English settlements in America, however, marked the increasingly important role of England in the Atlantic World.

The Moon blocks the Sun during new moon phase as seen from some parts of Earth and casts a shadow on our planet.

astronomy Chapter 4 #8  pass     0.1421  Why don’t lunar eclipses happen during every full moon?                                                                      Because the Moon’s orbit is tilted relative to the plane of Earth’s orbit about the Sun by about 5°.  As a result, during most months, the Moon is sufficiently above or below the ecliptic plane to avoid an eclipse.  But when the two paths cross (twice a year), it is then “eclipse season” and eclipses are possible.

US history chap 3 #3    pass     0.1897  How did the Pueblo attempt to maintain their autonomy in the face of Spanish settlement?                                     They attempted to maintain their autonomy in the face of Spanish settlement by attempting to fold Christian traditions into their own practices. However, Spanish priests insisted that natives discard their old ways entirely and angered the Pueblo by focusing on the young, drawing them away from their parents. This deep insult, combined with an extended period of drought and increased attacks by local Apache and Navajo in the 1670s—troubles that the Pueblo came to believe were linked to the Spanish presence—moved the Pueblo to push the Spanish and their religion from the area.
