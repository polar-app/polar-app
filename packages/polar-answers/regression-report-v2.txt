astronomy Chapter 2 #7  unknown  0.8355  How are the zodiacal constellations different from the other constellations?                                                 The zodiacal constellations are different from the other constellations because they are not in the same plane as the other constellations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
astronomy Chapter 4 #2  unknown  0.7987  What are the main advantage and disadvantage of apparent solar time?                                                         The main advantage of apparent solar time is that it is easy to use.  It is based on the position of the Sun in the sky, and it is easy to tell what time it is by looking at the Sun.  The main disadvantage of apparent solar time is that it is not very accurate.  The length of an apparent solar day varies slightly during the year.  The length of a mean solar day is constant.  The length of a sidereal day is defined by the positions of the stars in the sky.  The length of a sidereal day is constant.  The length of a mean solar day is defined by the average value of a solar day during the year.  The length of a sidereal day is constant.

astronomy Chapter 4 #4  unknown  0.2804  Why is it difficult to construct a practical calendar based on the Moon’s cycle of phases?                                   The Moon’s cycle of phases is not commensurable with the rotation period of Earth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
astronomy Chapter 4 #5  unknown  0.338   What is the phase of the Moon during a total solar eclipse?                                                                  The Moon blocks the Sun during new moon phase as seen from some parts of Earth and casts a shadow on our planet. The corona (thin outer atmosphere) of the Sun is visible during a total solar eclipse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
astronomy Chapter 4 #8  unknown  0.2327  Why don’t lunar eclipses happen during every full moon?                                                                      Because the Moon’s orbit is tilted relative to the plane of Earth’s orbit about the Sun by about 5°, lunar eclipses happen only when the Moon’s path crosses the ecliptic plane.

astronomy Chapter 2 #6  fail     0.3476  Give at least one of Aristotle's arguments why he considered the earth to be round                                           Aristotle cited convincing arguments that Earth must be round.  First is the fact that as the Moon enters or emerges from Earth’s shadow during an eclipse of the Moon, the shape of the shadow seen on the Moon is always round (Figure 2.9).  Only a spherical object always produces a round shadow.  If Earth were a disk, for example, there would be some occasions when the sunlight would strike it edge-on and its shadow on the Moon would be a line. The more distant an object, the more nearly parallel the rays of light coming from it.  Of course, the Sun is not infinitely far away, but given its distance of 150 million kilometers, light rays striking Earth from a point on the Sun diverge from one another by an angle far too small to be observed with the unaided eye.  As a consequence, if people all over Earth who could see the Sun were to point at it, their fingers would appear to be at different distances from the Sun.  As a second argument, Aristotle explained that travelers who go south a significant distance are able to observe stars that are not visible farther north.  15.  How did Aristotle deduce that the Sun is farther away from Earth than the

The Sun is much closer to Earth than are the nearest stars, yet it is not possible to measure accurately the diurnal parallax of the Sun relative to the stars by measuring its position relative to background objects in the sky directly.

US history chap 3 #3    pass     0.2901  How did the Pueblo attempt to maintain their autonomy in the face of Spanish settlement?                                     They attempted to maintain their autonomy in the face of Spanish settlement by attempting to fold Christian traditions into their own practices. However, Spanish priests insisted that natives discard their old ways entirely and angered the Pueblo by focusing on the young, drawing them away from their parents. This deep insult, combined with an extended period of drought and increased attacks by local Apache and Navajo in the 1670s—troubles that the Pueblo came to believe were linked to the Spanish presence—moved the Pueblo to push the Spanish and their religion from the area.
