astronomy Chapter 2 #7  unknown  0.0539  How are the zodiacal constellations different from the other constellations?                                                 The zodiacal constellations are different from the other constellations because they are not in the same place in the sky as the other constellations.  The zodiacal constellations are in the same place in the sky as the other constellations, but they are not in the same place in the sky as the constellations of the zodiac.  The constellations of the zodiac are in the same place in the sky as the constellations of the zodiac, but they are not in the same place in the sky as the constellations of the zodiac.
astronomy Chapter 3 #2  unknown  0.1248  What's Newton's first law?                                                                                                   Newton's first law is a restatement of one of Galileo's discoveries, called the conservation of momentum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
astronomy Chapter 4 #1  unknown  0.1383  Why does longitude have no meaning at the North and South Poles?                                                             Because the celestial poles are at the north and south points on the horizon, they are not overhead or on the horizon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
astronomy Chapter 4 #2  unknown  0.1428  What are the main advantage and disadvantage of apparent solar time?                                                         The main advantage is that it is easy to remember. The main disadvantage is that it is not accurate.

astronomy Chapter 4 #4  unknown  0.0768  Why is it difficult to construct a practical calendar based on the Moon’s cycle of phases?                                   Because the Moon’s period of revolution is the same as its period of rotation, the Moon always keeps the same face toward Earth.  In countries at far northern latitudes, the winter months tend to be so cloudy that astronomical observations are nearly impossible.  Why can’t good observations of the stars be made at those places during the summer months?                                                                                                                                                             
astronomy Chapter 4 #5  unknown  0.0527  What is the phase of the Moon during a total solar eclipse?                                                                  The Moon blocks the Sun during new moon phase as seen from some parts of Earth and casts a shadow on our planet. Strictly speaking, should the period during which there are two high tides be 24 hours? If not, what should the interval be? 8. What is the phase of the Moon during a total solar eclipse? Describe what an observer at the crater Copernicus would see while the Moon is eclipsed on Earth. What would the same observer see during what would be a total solar eclipse as viewed from Earth? 35.           
astronomy Chapter 4 #6  unknown  0.117   Why is the leap year necessary?                                                                                              The Julian calendar was adopted by the early Christian Church in the fourth century CE. It was based on the cycle of the Moon, and it was designed to keep the average length of the year in the calendar at 365.25 days. The average length of the year was 365.2422 days, but the calendar was off by 11 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                            
astronomy Chapter 4 #9  unknown  0.0848  Why some places have very small tides while in other places huge tides?                                                      The tides are caused by the Moon’s differential force on the material of Earth’s crust and ocean. These tidal forces cause ocean water to flow into two tidal bulges on opposite sides of Earth; each day, Earth rotates through these bulges. The rotation of Earth would carry an observer at any given place alternately into regions of deeper and shallower water.                                                                                                                                                        
US history chap 1 #4    unknown  0.0952  What were the major differences between the societies of the Aztec, Inca, and Maya and the Native peoples of North America?  The Native peoples of North America were much more widely dispersed than the Mayan, Aztec, and Incan societies, and did not have their population size or organized social structures. Although the cultivation of corn had made its way north, many Native people still practiced hunting and gathering. In the Chesapeake Bay and New England colonies, conflicts erupted as the English pushed against their native neighbors.

They could obtain encomiendas by proving their service to the crown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
US history chap 2 #13   unknown  0.1289  Why did diseases like smallpox affect Native Americans so badly?                                                             Because almost all diseases that affect humans are mutated strains of diseases affecting domestic animals, and all of the large animal species that can be domesticated were Eurasian in origin except llamas, Eurasians and Africans had spent thousands of years both suffering from and building up resistance to epidemics while Native Americans had not.                                                                                                                                                                 
US history chap 2 #8    unknown  0.1372  Why didn’t England make stronger attempts to colonize the New World before the late sixteenth to early seventeenth century?

Because the Moon’s orbit is tilted relative to the plane of Earth’s orbit about the Sun by about 5°.  As a result, during most months, the Moon is sufficiently above or below the ecliptic plane to avoid an eclipse.  But when the two paths cross (twice a year), it is then “eclipse season” and eclipses are possible.
