astronomy Chapter 3 #1  unknown  0.0216  What is the orbital speed?                                                                                                   The orbital speed of a planet traveling around the Sun (the circular object inside the ellipse) varies in such a way that in equal intervals of time (t), a line between the Sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas (A and B).  The eccentricities of the planets’ orbits in our solar system are substantially less than shown here.  Kepler’s Third Law Kepler’s first two laws of planetary motion describe the shape of a planet’s orbit and allow us to calculate the speed of its motion at any point in the orbit.  Kepler was pleased to have discovered such fundamental rules, but they did not satisfy his quest to fully understand planetary motions. The average orbital data for the planets are summarized in Table 3.2.  (Ceres is the largest of the asteroids, now considered a dwarf planet.)  According to Kepler’s laws, Mercury must have the shortest orbital period (88 Earth-days); thus, it has the highest orbital speed, averaging 48 kilometers per second.  At the opposite extreme, Neptune has a period of Check Your Learning Suppose a star with twice the mass of our Sun had an earthlike planet that took 4 years to orbit the star.

astronomy Chapter 3 #2  unknown  0.026   What's Newton's first law?                                                                                                   Newton’s first law is a restatement of one of Galileo’s discoveries, called the conservation of momentum.  The law states that in the absence of any outside influence, there is a measure of a body’s motion, called its momentum, that remains unchanged.  You may have heard the term momentum used in everyday expressions, such as “This bill in Congress has a lot of momentum; it’s going to be hard to stop.”  Newton’s first law is sometimes called the law of inertia, where inertia is the tendency of objects (and legislatures) to keep doing what they are already doing.  In other words, a stationary object stays put, and a moving object keeps moving unless some force intervenes.  Let’s define the precise meaning of momentum—it depends on three factors: (1) speed—how fast a body moves (zero if it is stationary), (2) the direction of its motion, and (3) its mass—a measure of the amount of matter in a body, which we will discuss later.  Scientists use the term velocity to describe the speed and direction of motion.  How does Newton’s first law of

astronomy Chapter 4 #9  unknown  0.0261  Why some places have very small tides while in other places huge tides?                                                      The Sun and the Moon are aligned in a way that causes the Sun to pull on Earth and the Moon to pull on Earth.  The Sun’s and Moon’s pulls reinforce each other and so are greater than usual.  The “simple” theory of tides, described in the preceding paragraphs, would be sufficient if Earth rotated very slowly and were completely surrounded by very deep oceans.  However, the presence of land masses stopping the flow of water, the friction in the oceans and between oceans and the ocean floors, the rotation of Earth, the wind, the variable depth of the ocean, and other factors all complicate the picture.  This is why, in the real world, some places have very small tides while in other places huge tides become tourist attractions.  If you have been in such places, you may know that “tide tables” need to be computed and published for each location; one set of tide predictions doesn’t work for the whole planet.  In this introductory chapter, we won’t delve further into these complexities.
