Basically the V6 model BUT we use the new result joiner to compute an ES AND query which cuts down on data sent to OpenAI.

astronomy #1            unknown  0.0034  Compare Mars with Mercury and the Moon in terms of overall properties.  What are the similarities and differences?           Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is the second smallest planet in the Solar System. It is also the second most distant planet from the Sun. It is the second most massive planet in the Solar System. It is the second most dense planet in the Solar System.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
astronomy #2            unknown  0.0089  Contrast the mountains on Mars and Venus with those on Earth and the Moon.                                                   The mountains on the terrestrial planets owe their origins to different processes.

astronomy Chapter 2 #6  unknown  0.0052  Give at least one of Aristotle's arguments why he considered the earth to be round                                           Aristotle knew that the Sun has to be farther away from Earth than is the Moon because occasionally the Moon passed exactly between Earth and the Sun and hid the Sun temporarily from view.  We call this a solar eclipse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
astronomy Chapter 2 #7  unknown  0.0539  How are the zodiacal constellations different from the other constellations?                                                 The zodiacal constellations are different from the other constellations because they are not in the same place in the sky as the other constellations.  The zodiacal constellations are in the same place in the sky as the other constellations, but they are not in the same place in the sky as the constellations of the zodiac.  The constellations of the zodiac are in the same place in the sky as the constellations of the zodiac, but they are not in the same place in the sky as the constellations of the zodiac.

Objects at rest will stay at rest and objects in motion will continue moving uniformly in a straight line unless acted upon by a force.

Because the poles are at the ends of the Earth.

The main advantage is that it is easy to calculate the time of day. The main disadvantage is that it is not accurate.

The Moon’s cycle of phases results from the changing angle of its illumination by the Sun.

Because the year is not divisible by 400.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
astronomy Chapter 4 #8  unknown  0.0584  Why don’t lunar eclipses happen during every full moon?                                                                      The Moon’s orbit is tilted relative to the plane of Earth’s orbit about the Sun by about 5° (imagine two hula hoops with a common center, but tilted a bit).  As a result, during most months, the Moon is sufficiently above or below the ecliptic plane to avoid an eclipse.  But when the two paths cross (twice a year), it is then “eclipse season” and eclipses are possible.
