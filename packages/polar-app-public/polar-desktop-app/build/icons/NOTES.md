# Linux: this option is not required, as the dock/window list icon is set via
# the icon option in the BrowserWindow constructor. Please note that you need
# to use a PNG, and not the OS X or Windows icon formats, in order for it to
# show up in the dock/window list. Setting the icon in the file manager is not
# currently supported.
