- DONE???: get new windows to open up correctly with window.open in a new tab (and
  in the) browser too OR use new tabs API

    I can look for polar-desktop-app in the user-agent... 
  
- get anki sync to work by just enabling the button? How do I determine if 
  I'm in Electron...?

- test everything in the desktop app and make sure it works properly

- get updates system to work

    This is part of: 

        /Users/burton/projects/polar-app/packages/polar-bookshelf/web/js/updates/Updates.ts
    
    and UpdatesController but we don't need that part yet.
