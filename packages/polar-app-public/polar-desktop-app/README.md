# Requirements:

- copy / paste should work
- auto-updater should work and just automatically install itself on restart
- use latest Electron 9.x release
- SUPER simple app 
- just start https://beta.getpolarized.io and load the PWA there
- do NOT use the webserver - it's not needed anymore since we serve from 
  beta.getpolarized.io
