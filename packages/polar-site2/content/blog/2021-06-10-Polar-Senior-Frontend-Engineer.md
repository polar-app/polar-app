# Polar Senior Frontend Engineer

Polar is looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our team to reinvent EdTech!

## Overview

At Polar, we believe that the next generation of knowledge tools will organize
data similarly to how the brain is structured.  When paired with artificial
intelligence we believe this will radically improve human cognition.

To achieve this, we are looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our team
as soon as possible.

# Team
 
We are a small team of five with previous experience in startups, tech, and
growth, with deep frontend, backend, and BigData and search background.

# Role requirements

Our ideal candidate has a strong background in frontend development, a fullstack interest, and
preferably some AI experience. Specifically:

- Min 5 years of frontend experience - Javascript, React, React Native, PWAs, NodeJS
- Decent understanding of developing on phone, mobile, and desktop
- Understanding of web browser internals and modern APIs (service workers, PWAs,
offline, etc)
- Experience with Typescript and Firebase preferred
- Experience with PDFs or EPUBs big plus
- Strong preference for previous startup experience
- Analytical thinking. Deep respect for the scientific method and objective data analysis
- Location: Anywhere with preference for South/Latin America, Eastern Europe, Egypt

You will be one of the first people on the team, so this is a crucial decision
for us. We strongly respect your work life balance, but we are looking for
someone who is passionate about the product and role, not just another 9-5 job.
We want someone whose incentives are aligned with ours and who is as passionate
about building an early stage startup as we are.

Your compensation package will be a mix of cash and equity - with the exact
split depending on your experience and your personal preference.

If you’re interested, please reach out via the Intercom button in our app.
Please include your resume, LinkedIn, and github. Please also add a few summary
sentences about you and your interest in Polar.

We are looking to fill this role as soon as possible, and are hiring on a
rolling basis. We’re looking forward to your application!
