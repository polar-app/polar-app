# Polar Senior Frontend React Engineer

<img alt="React" src="https://i.imgur.com/a7bN3HY.png">

Polar is looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our team to reinvent EdTech!

## Our mission

At Polar, we believe that the next generation of knowledge tools will organize
data similarly to how the brain is structured.  When paired with artificial
intelligence we believe this will radically improve human cognition.

In addition, education and research currently lacks a set of strong tools to provide anybody with equal opportunities, especially in the day of remote and digital-first learning and researching. We at Polar want to contribute to making it a more equal playing field for anybody.

To achieve this, we are looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our team
as soon as possible.

## Our culture

We are a remote-first startup. We initially founded the startup in SF but moved fully remote in late 2019. At Polar, we're building a culture of mutual trust, openness, and strong ownership by each individual.

We are still a small team and you are one of our very first hires. This means, you joining us is a crucial decision. Based on our previous startup experience, we have a very clear idea what kind of startup we want to build. We want to make sure that this vision is in line with your ideal work place. 

In addition, we are looking to hire for the long-term. We are only interested in candidates who share our passion for education, our vision of democratizing education, and how we can get there as a team. 

We strongly respect your work life balance but we are looking for someone who is passionate about the product and role, not just another 9-5 job. We want someone whose incentives are aligned with ours and who is as passionate about building an early stage startup as we are. We are funded right now and plan to raise a round next year.

# Role requirements

Our ideal candidate has a strong background in frontend development, a fullstack interest, and
preferably some AI experience. Specifically:

- Min 5 years of frontend experience - Javascript, React, React Native, PWAs, NodeJS
- Decent understanding of developing on phone, mobile, and desktop
- Understanding of web browser internals and modern APIs (service workers, PWAs,
offline, etc)
- Experience with Typescript and Firebase preferred
- Experience with PDFs or EPUBs big plus
- Strong preference for previous startup experience
- Analytical thinking. Deep respect for the scientific method and objective data analysis
- Location: Anywhere with preference for South/Latin America, Eastern Europe, Egypt

You will be one of the first people on the team, so this is a crucial decision
for us. We strongly respect your work life balance, but we are looking for
someone who is passionate about the product and role, not just another 9-5 job.
We want someone whose incentives are aligned with ours and who is as passionate
about building an early stage startup as we are.

Your compensation package will be a mix of cash and equity - with the exact
split depending on your experience and your personal preference.

If you’re interested, please reach out via the Intercom button in our app.
Please include your resume, LinkedIn, and github. Please also add a few summary
sentences about you and your interest in Polar.

We are looking to fill this role as soon as possible, and are hiring on a
rolling basis. We’re looking forward to your application!

## Your challenge

Since we are a very small startup, your role will be more than just being one engineer in a big team. You will have major responsibilities from day 1. We provide hands-on mentorship and expect you to bring in best practices from your previous experiences. This includes making autonomous decisions, being clear and decisive about communication, and being a team player.

## Screening criteria

We screen candidates across various facets. Technically, we want to see a strong set of hard skills and competent decision making. Culturally, we look for candidates who are confident yet humble, decisive yet open to others' opinions, and someone who wants to build a large vision as part of a long-term team.
To ensure a good team fit, the first two month is typically conducted as a probationary period. We want to make sure that you are the right fit for us but also that we are the right fit for you.


## Team
 
We are a small team of five with previous experience in startups, tech, and
growth, with deep frontend, backend, and BigData and search background. The founding team has years of experience building startups and we are looking for team members with a similar startup-focused mindset.

We are Miami and Boulder-based but are building a remote-first team. Your location is of secondary importance but we do need at least 4-5 hours of overlap to work effectively with you. 

We aim to build a very relaxed company culture and are implementing various methods from our previous experiences in startups and consulting for that. We also have a Podcast called “Minimally Viable” where we discuss anything related to early-stage startups.

If you’re interested, please reach out to us inside the app through the Intercom button or shoot us a message at founders at getpolarized dot io with your resume, LinkedIn, and github. Please also add a few summary sentences about you and your interest in Polar.

We are looking to fill this role as soon as possible, and are hiring on a rolling basis. We’re looking forward to your application!
