# Polar Senior Frontend Engineer

Polar is looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our team to reinvent EdTech!

## Overview

At Polar, we believe that the next generation of knowledge tools will organize data
similarly to how the brain is structured, making it easier to manage and recall 
 
 but also pair this with Artificial
Intelligence to radically improve human cognition.

We're laser-focused on making it easier for our users to learn more efficiently. 

Either you can learn more in less time or decide to go full genius and beat out
your competition by simply being smarter.

To achieve this, we are looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our team
as soon as possible.

# Team
 
We are a small team of five with previous experience in startups, tech, and
growth, with deep frontend, backend, and BigData and search background.

# Role requirements

Our ideal candidate has a strong background in frontend development, a fullstack interest, and
preferably some AI experience. Specifically:

- Min 5 years of frontend experience - Javascript, React, React Native, PWAs, NodeJS
- Decent understanding of developing on phone, mobile, and desktop
- Understanding of web browser internals and modern APIs (service workers, PWAs,
offline, etc)
- Experience with Typescript and Firebase preferred
- Experience with PDFs or EPUBs big plus
- Strong preference for previous startup experience
- Analytical thinking. Deep respect for the scientific method and objective data analysis
- Location: Anywhere with preference for South/Latin America, Eastern Europe, Egypt

You will be one of the first people on the team, so this is a crucial decision
for us. We strongly respect your work life balance, but we are looking for
someone who is passionate about the product and role, not just another 9-5 job.
We want someone whose incentives are aligned with ours and who is as passionate
about building an early stage startup as we are.

Your compensation package will be a mix of cash and equity - with the exact
split depending on your experience and your personal preference.

- TODO: work with brilliant people
