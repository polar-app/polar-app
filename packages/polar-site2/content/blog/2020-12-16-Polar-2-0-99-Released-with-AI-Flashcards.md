# Polar 2.0.99 Released with Artificially Intelligent Flashcards

The simplest way to create flashcards from text highlights is finally here!

We are happy to announce that we have launched AI-generated flashcards using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> from <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI</a>

Simply highlight some text and click the button. It will take the text you
selected and automatically convert it into a question and answer flashcard that
you can sync to Anki or review directly in Polar.

Check it out in action here:

AI-generated flashcards will allow you to speed up and simplify creating
flashcards directly from text highlights.

We are using OpenAI's GPT-3 for this on the backend. Since GPT-3 is
content-agnostic, you can use this on any text highlight. Create the flashcards
the fastest way and sync them directly to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ankiweb.net/about">Anki</a>.

The feature is available to all Plus and Pro users.

A few tips on how to best use the feature:

- Use relatively short annotations - right now only one flashcard is generated
from annotations. We will increase this in the near future so you get several
flashcards from annotations. An additional advantage is that the latency is
shorter with shorter annotations.

- Use the feature for annotations where the question and answer is in the
annotation itself. The algorithm will only use information that is provided in
the text of the annotation.

- Maximum length of an annotation to run through this feature is 750 characters

- Only one flashcard is generated per annotation - this will be increased over time

- Plus users get 100 flashcard generations per month, Pro get 250 / month

We plan to also add cloze deletions with this feature in the foreseeable future.

Finally, since we are approaching the holidays very quickly, we are also doing a
special holiday sales for new upgrades. Use the code 2020Out to get 20% off on a
new year-long Plus or Pro plan (redeemable until Jan 2).
