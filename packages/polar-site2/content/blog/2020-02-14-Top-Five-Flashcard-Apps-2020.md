## Summary

  

People and developers are finding new ways of using flashcard tools. <a href="https://thesector.com.au/2020/02/03/a-21st-century-approach-to-emergent-literacy-no-flashcards-in-preschool-please/">Some are opposing it</a> as well, especially in playschools, saying that early learning needs to be creative and challenging. Flashcards have nothing against extensive print learning, they’re a proven way of learning new information. Sometimes the new stuff does not have much of a creative approach to it, as in the case of the many medical terminologies.

  

Besides, flashcards can be fun. The add-ons for Anki have made them more engaging and interactive, where they are more than just binary. Their integrations to document managers such as Polar have also proved how they can be effectively integrated to find more applications.

  

Finally, flashcards are particularly powerful when coupled with other learning methods. In particular, association or absurd and ridiculous imagery can help tremendously in retaining information on flashcards.
