<h1>Polar 1.11 Released</h1>

<p>
    Version 1.11 has fewer features than our normal weekly
    releases. The next release will take a bit longer and we
    wanted to get a version released sooner rather than
    later.
</p>

<ul>

    <li>Feature: More consistent header bar throughout the app.
    </li>

    <li>Feature: Pagemark batches which help working with
        PDFs that have multiple pages.  Now if you create
        pagemarks across pages you can delete one and the whole
        batch is also deleted.
    </li>

    <li>
        Feature: Page number in markdown export
    </li>

    <li>
        Feature: Disabled the top message boxes.  They were
        annoying and only a stop gap until we have a proper
        onboarding mechanism.
    </li>

    <li> Bug: Fixed bug with page zoom not working properly
        in the HTML viewer.  The zoom now works but pagemarks
        still aren't placed properly. </li>

    <li>
        Upgrade: Electron 3.1.2
    </li>

    <li> Donate and Discord buttons in header.  These are
        important. </li>

    <li>
        Feature: Setting POLAR_DISABLE_HARDWARE_ACCELERATION
        should disable hardwawre acceleration now if that's
        causing a problem for you.
    </li>

</ul>
