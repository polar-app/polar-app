## Overview

At Polar, our vision is to democratize education and provide studying and knowledge tools that will enable the next generation of students, scientists, and founders to achieve their full potential.

To achieve this, we are looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our team as soon as possible. We are a team of two founders with previous experience in startups, tech, and growth, and two engineers. We are looking for someone with strong frontend experience and preferably previous startup experience. Compensation is competitive and a mix of cash and equity. See details below.

## Role requirements

Our ideal candidate has a strong background in frontend development, a fullstack interest, and preferably some AI experience. Specifically:
- Min 5 years of frontend experience - Javascript, React, React Native, PWAs, NodeJS
- Decent understanding of developing on phone, mobile, and desktop
- Understanding of web browser internals and modern APIs (service workers, PWAs, offline, etc)
- Experience with Typescript and Firebase preferred
- Experience with PDFs or EPUBs big plus
- Strong preference for previous startup experience
- Analytical thinking. Deep respect for the scientific method and objective data analysis
- Location: Remote only, with preference for South America and Eastern Europe

You are part of the first round of hires here at Polar, so this is a crucial decision for us. We strongly respect your work life
balance but we are looking for someone who is passionate about the product and role, not just another 9-5 job. We want someone whose incentives are aligned with ours and who is as passionate about building an early stage startup as we are.

Your compensation package will be a mix of cash and equity - with the exact split depending on your experience and your personal preference

## About us

We are a team of two founders with over 35 years of combined experience in startups, tech, growth, and business.
- Kevin is founder and focused on development and product. He recently sold his last startup. Polar is his fourth startup. He is also one of the inventors of RSS
- Jonathan is founder and focused on product and growth. He received his PhD from Yale and worked at BCG (management consulting) for five years before founding Polar

We are SF and Boulder-based but are building a remote-first team. Your location is of secondary importance but we do need at least 4-5 hours of overlap to work effectively with you. We have a very relaxed company culture and are implementing various methods from our previous experiences in startups and consulting to actively reinforce that. If you’re interested, please reach out to us in-app through Intercom or per email (jonathan at getpolarized dot io) with your resume, LinkedIn, and github. Please also add a few summary sentences about you and your interest in Polar.

We are looking to fill this role as soon as possible, and are hiring on a rolling basis. We’re looking forward to your application!
