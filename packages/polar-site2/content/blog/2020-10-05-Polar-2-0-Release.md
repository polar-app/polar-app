# Polar 2.0 Released. Dark Mode. EPUB, Improved Web Capture, etc. 

Polar 2.0 was released on October 12, 2020. This release focused on major stability improvements along with the introduction of various new features. With the introduction of 2.0, the plans have also been updated to reflect changes those changes (e.g., users on the free plan will now receive 1 GB of storage instead of 350 MB).

# Dark mode

This was the #1 requested feature in the past. Polar is from now on dark mode by default. You can easily switch back to light mode in the settings.

# EPUB support

Polar now supports EPUBs. At the time of the 2.0 release, EPUBs supports all features as other files excluding area highlights. The document viewer was also rewritten to support EPUBs.

# Improved Anki support

The Anki sync has been revamped from the ground up. This includes no more excess tags, faster syncing as we removed the need to read DocMeta from Firestore, better shortcuts UI, and various other updates.

# Shortcuts

Polar now supports a vast array of shortcuts. You can find all shortcuts for a specific page by clicking ```/``` or ```shift``` + ```/```

# Web capture

The Chrome extension was also rebuilt from the ground up. The main reason is to support new features like dark mode or reflow and improve its performance. The web capture now uses Mozillaâ€™s Readability, thereby stripping the page down to just the important parts.

In addition, this redesign enables you to keep using cookies, ad block, and other extensions in your browser while capturing a page.

Captured pages are stored as EPUBs.

If you want to use pages captured in Polar 1.0, you can use our importer to convert captured pages from 1.0 to 2.0.

# Cloud-first

From 2.0 onward, Polar will only support cloud storage. If you have been a user in Polar 1.0 with local storage, Polar will detect your local .polar directory and import it into your cloud account

This design will significantly improve stability, improve the offline experience, allow easy syncing across devices, and improve various other features.

# General stability

Polar 2.0 was largely rewritten from the ground up. As with any early-stage tool, you will experience bugs from time to time. However, that should be significantly reduced vs. Polar 1.0.

# Updates to plans

We released updated plans to reflect changes in Polar 2.0 vs. Polar 1.0. 

Firstly, the free plan is getting an increase in storage from 350 MB to 1 GB to reflect the change to cloud storage only. In addition, any existing free plan users will get 2 GB of storage.
