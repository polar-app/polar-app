# Polar Senior Frontend Engineer

## Overview


We at Polar are looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our team as soon as possible.
We are a team of two founders and a slowly growing engineering team with previous experience in startups, tech, and growth. We are
looking for someone with strong frontend experience and preferably previous startup
experience. Compensation is competitive and a mix of cash and equity

# Role requirements

Our ideal candidate has a strong background in frontend development, a fullstack interest, and
preferably some AI experience. Specifically:
- Min 5 years of frontend experience - Javascript, React, React Native, PWAs, NodeJS
- Decent understanding of developing on phone, mobile, and desktop
- Understanding of web browser internals and modern APIs (service workers, PWAs,
offline, etc)
- Experience with Typescript and Firebase preferred
- Experience with PDFs or EPUBs big plus
- Strong preference for previous startup experience
- Analytical thinking. Deep respect for the scientific method and objective data analysis
- Location: Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Spain

You will be one of the first people on the team, so this is a crucial decision for us. We strongly respect your work life
balance but we are looking for someone who is passionate about the product and role, not just
another 9-5 job. We want someone whose incentives are aligned with ours and who is as
passionate about building an early stage startup as we are.

Your compensation package will be a mix of cash and equity - with the exact split depending on
your experience and your personal preference

# About us

We are a team of two founders with over 35 years of combined experience in startups, tech,
growth, and business.
- Kevin is founder and focused on development and product. He recently sold his last
startup. Polar is his fourth startup. He is also one of the inventors of RSS
Read. Learn. Never Forget.
- Jonathan is founder and focused on product and growth. He received his PhD from Yale
and worked at BCG (management consulting) for five years before founding Polar

We are SF and Boulder-based but are building a remote-first team. Your location is of
secondary importance but we do need at least 4-5 hours of overlap to work effectively with you.

We aim to build a very relaxed company culture and are implementing various methods from our
previous experiences in startups and consulting for that.

If you’re interested, please reach out by email or vial the Intercom button on our platform. Please include your resume,
LinkedIn, and github. Please also add a few summary sentences about you and your interest in
Polar.

We are looking to fill this role as soon as possible, and are hiring on a rolling basis. We’re
looking forward to your application!
