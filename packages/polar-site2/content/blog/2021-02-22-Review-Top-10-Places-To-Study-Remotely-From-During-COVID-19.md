# [Review] Top 10 places to study from remotely during COVID-19

## Learning in times like this

With the onset of the pandemic, not only all of our social lives changed, but actually everything. From our lives surrounded by friends to how we go on vacations. But not everything was negative. Especially academically, many positive aspects and opportunities have opened up. Remote learning made everything much more flexible. You can arrange your own schedule as you see fit, you can spend time with loved ones while taking classes (don’t we all want to spend mooooore time with our families?! 😜), and you can learn with the tools that work best for you. However, a first-time opportunity is to attend a lecture from the other side of the world even if you’re not a typical “online” school (yes I’m looking at you, Phoenix University 🙃). And that's exactly what this post is about. The most beautiful and best places for remote studying from anywhere in the world. But, if you want to learn more about studying in times of a pandemic, you should check out <a href="https://getpolarized.io/2020/06/02/How-I-Successfully-Coped-With-the-Pandemic-A-Student's-Perspective.html" target="_blank">this</a> article (a few of the tips have literally saved me from losing control of my life completely 😬😅).

According to <a href="https://www.hireahelper.com/moving-statistics/covid-migration-report/" target="_blank">hire a helper</a>, 25% of moves last year were due to the pandemic. And by no means only internationally, but also within your home country, for example from the expensive big cities to cheaper areas, or simply because the sun shines longer elsewhere (I mean as attractive as New England is in the winter, you can’t beat Miami sun in February…). But, what actually makes a place a good place for students to learn? And where is it worth spending time during your pandemic studies?

Well, first of all, entry restrictions and pandemic restrictions are obviously the first consideration. Not only to get in at all, but also to have as carefree a life as possible there. That takes New Zealand and Australia categorically out of the equation. Next, a location needs to be as study-friendly as possible. There should be as many places for like-minded people to create a good and suitable learning environment in addition to leisure activities (of course only socially distanced at 6 ft, with mask, and all that 💁‍♂️). <a href="https://medium.com/@Alice_Puzzles/why-studying-in-coffee-shops-is-sweeter-than-christmas-morning-d7c5b22e2b80" target="_blank">Coffee shops</a>, libraries and museums are particularly well suited for this. What you should not forget, of course, is good weather (no, not only for chilling😜), but also to study relaxed at the coffee shop in the sun. Anyway, that's better than learning in the snow;)Based on that, we have selected for you the 10 most suitable locations that are currently the must-go places for students.

## The USA. From Miami to Hawaii.

### Miami

<img alt="Graphic Polar Miami" src="https://i.imgur.com/XgrTokP.jpg">  

Miami is probably THE most popular city to study remotely right now. This is definitely not just because of the good weather. There are numerous other reasons why many young people are drawn to Miami to ride out the pandemic. For one thing, there is the super infrastructure. With two major airports nearby, not only is the entire U.S. accessible by flight, but the same is true for Latin and South America. In need of a weekend trip? Well, Colombia is right around the corner (I mean yeah… it’s still across some water but totally worth it). Miami Beach is obviously worth seeing (most likely you’ll be staying there anyway), but Fort Lauderdale is also worth a trip or two. Since the Internet is also particularly good in Miami, you don't have to worry about attending your classes without being kicked off the call.

### Austin

For those who love the Southern style, Austin, Texas is the place to be. Here you can find everything your splurging heart desires. Barbeque, young people, sun and the ever-growing startup culture are all there. Even before the pandemic, Austin was one of the most popular cities to work from remotely. Not only does good and free internet make it attractive, the urban city life and accessibility in general compound the effect (again, only in a socially distanced setting ☝). There are numerous co-working spaces that are open to everyone and outside in the warm sun, and of course there is no shortage of student coffee shops.
Well, we clearly wrote this before the storm of the century arrived in TX... anyway, Austin is still a great option and doesn't seem to have lost much popularity despite some hiccups on the road. And hey - if you need to get away for a few days, just Cruz to Mexico... 🤷‍

### San Diego

<img alt="Graphic Polar San Diego" src="https://i.imgur.com/FfxMaqv.jpg">     

San Diego. Famous for the good weather (and the <a href="https://www.spendlifetraveling.com/san-diego-top-8-coffee-shops-to-work-study/" target="_blank">numerous</a> coffee shops☕). Freelancers and contractors in particular have long been drawn here. You should be able to find a suitable place for everyone here, where you can spend the first half of the day at schools and the second half chasing the best waves. In particular, the Meraki Cafe is especially recommended. Close to schools like UCSD, you can enjoy the perfect learning atmosphere with free wifi. Perfect! (well, minus the pandemic - but almost perfect!)

### Los Angeles

<img alt="Graphic Polar Los Angeles" src="https://i.imgur.com/4lj5xHB.jpg">     

Famous for the stars and starlets who serve the pandemic in Beverly Hills, the City of Angels has but much to offer us students. Especially the city’s cultural diversity is palpable. Food from all over the world, clothing stores with worldwide fashion, co-working spaces and the ocean right outside the door. Even though Los Angeles is definitely one of the more expensive cities on this list, it is especially recommended for students in the musical-artistic field. And who knows, maybe  <a href="https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/things-to-do/where-to-spot-a-celebrity-in-los-angeles" target="_blank">you'll run into a real star</a> on your way to Starbucks on your first day.

### Hawaii

<img alt="Graphic Polar Hawaii" src="https://i.imgur.com/7S13PHD.jpg">     

Feel like partying until dawn, then relaxing in the hammock during the lecture? That's right, I'm talking about Hawaii. Hawaii is perfect for the more party and action-loving among you. It has numerous coffee shops and a tight-knit student community. Not to forget, of course, the nature of Hawaii. From the <a href="https://traveltriangle.com/blog/beaches-in-hawaii/" target="_blank">beautiful beaches</a> to <a href="https://www.travelawaits.com/2479232/how-to-visit-diamond-head-oahu/" target="_blank">Diamond Head</a> on Oahu. But don't forget that you have to enter with a negative covid test (who wants to leave paradise before even arriving or be stuck in a hotel room for two weeks 😱).

## Worldwide. From Tulum to Bangkok.

### Tulum

<img alt="Graphic Polar Tulum" src="https://i.imgur.com/cwK6vXO.jpg">        

Tulum is currently the star among the cities of Mexico. From influencers to regular remote workers, everyone wants to come here. Of course, who wouldn't want to live in the paradise par excellence? Even though it is definitely one of the most expensive cities in Mexico, it is comparable to most big cities in the United States. An advantage of Tulum is that everything is within walking distance.  <a href="https://travelstanddesk.com/coworking-space-tulum/" target="_blank">Co-working spaces</a> here also look a bit different (and nicer!) than elsewhere. It's the definition of relaxed learning. Currently it is one of the hottest places for the top DJs from all over the world. So if you want to party properly after learning, you will not be disappointed here😉.

### Berlin

<img alt="Graphic Polar Berlin" src="https://i.imgur.com/EJTT4uu.jpg">    

Cold but gold. Berlin's burgeoning youth scene is perfect for students from all over the world. Even though it's not quite on par to other cities in terms of weather and climate, the startup and club scene is one of the best in the world, and rightly so. From Soundcloud to Tier Mobility, they've all been kicked off in Berlin. Especially for students looking to become entrepreneurs, this is a great opportunity to gain some hands-on startup experience while studying. After a long day of studying, you can end the evening in one of the many clubs. Additionally, the Internet in Berlin is super fast and public transport will get you anywhere.

### Canary Islands

<img alt="Graphic Polar Canary Islands" src="https://i.imgur.com/S2ZWm9E.jpg">      

Not only am I enthusiastic about the Canary Islands, but so is <a href="https://nomadlist.com/" target="_blank">nomadlist.com</a>! Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Canary Islands have continuously been in the top 10 list of cities best suited for <a href="https://www.guidetocanaryislands.com/digital-nomads-canary-islands/" target="_blank">remote workers</a>. The Canary Islands combine many things that other places can only dream of. Fast Internet, perfect health care, multinational influences, security and low cost of living. Gran Canaria and Tenerife is loved by many young people., Trust me, your social life will not suffer over there. Co-working spaces are somewhat limited, but the coffee shops score all the more.

### Cabo

<img alt="Graphic Polar Cabo" src="https://i.imgur.com/Doiuene.jpg">      

Yet another city in Mexico. For those who want to combine remote learning, partying and relaxation as best as possible, Cabo San Lucas is the place to be. Known for its surfing opportunities and wild nightlife, it also has numerous advantages for remote students who want to combine learning with fun. There are numerous co-working spaces, all of which are air-conditioned and equipped with fast wifi. The coffee shops are also well worth a visit. Cafe Cabo and The Cabo Coffee Company stand out in that category. An advantage are the nearby excursion possibilities, which makes a stay in Mexico even better.

### Bangkok

<img alt="Graphic Polar Bangkok" src="https://i.imgur.com/15iDkfj.jpg">     

Even though Bangkok is one of the most crowded sities , Bangkok is definitely worth a trip. Due to Bangkok's internationality, it is quite easy to make friends. In addition, Bangkok is very safe even at late hours and you have the fastest internet you can dream. Bangkok also has a lot to offer culturally. From traditional Thai cuisine to a trip to <a href="https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2014/08/reclining-buddha-wat-pho-bangkok-thailand/" target="_blank">Wat Pho</a>, everything is possible. Perfect for urban lovers who like a bit of adventure and metropolitan.

### The best of the best.

My choice would definitely fall on all of them (duh! 😎😛). Well, at least once I would like to see all those places in my life. However, if I had to choose one, my choice would be Hawaii. I don't have to leave the country or travel too far to experience something completely different from what I'm used to at the moment. In addition, you will have less trouble coming home should the situation worsen and lockdowns tighten. For those who also absolutely want to spend their remote studying time away from home, I recommend taking a look at <a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=356980&label=gog235jc-1DCAMo7AFCBHBhZ2VIB1gDaDuIAQGYAQe4ARfIAQzYAQPoAQH4AQKIAgGoAgO4AtnEtIEGwAIB0gIkY2U1NmZjMDQtOGE2YS00Mjc1LThmY2ItOGViODUwM2FjMTQ02AIE4AIB&sid=27c0752b08bb33c8733df7dde2e14b3b&lang=en-us&sb_price_type=total&soz=1&lang_click=other;cdl=de;lang_changed=1" target="_blank">booking portals</a>. Those oftentimes offer great deals for students,even more so during this pandemic.
