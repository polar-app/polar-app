# Must-have Anki Add-ons for Medical Students in 2020

We all know med school is tough and the amount of information required to memorize is tremendous. So obviously the question begs why not make it easy on yourself and use some powerful tools?

Anki is an open source flashcard software. If you’re here, you likely know how popular it is among med school students. Since it’s open source, anyone can build on top of it. So we decided to compile a list of most popular add-ons we heard from <a href="https://getpolarized.io/">our users</a>!
  

<img class="img-fluid border" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/knT-rTG6qdw8OlKZUIijJm2_r2d6-tB3_Dop0AouIW9WUmaFCvsSAxL-b1uqpjxppt1ubnVVqwjobPGfU2qaGZpho1w8YEESLBd2OS_c6AXinYz-YBdO97q9nxR--KXLrOec4sq_">

  

You can find the free add-ons on the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/2.1">Anki website</a> to improve your Anki experience.

There are hundreds of add-ons by other Anki users. With every Anki update, more functionality is added, especially through support of more add-ons.

  

We have categorized these Anki add-ons to make it easy to find what you are looking for. While these Anki add-ons are great for med students, they can be used by other students or casual learners as well.

  

<img class="img-fluid border" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hpJLma7qa1jb98a0y_AUdwsW7HCVio2-82yd6FYOj3VbyKU3aYMuT1xZWLDTwBGUJe7kOUio5s-YPoHbUr1WxSbM462fFWj6qHyVswBpK6dI1G71iGRVTk6rRMuMdgK-cbWVcg6v">

  

To install an Anki add-on, go to the tools menu and then Add-ons, then click on Browse & Install and paste in the code. Here's also a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saVJN5-_JDM) that explains this process.

  

With that, let’s get started.

## Gamification

  

These add-ons will bring some fun to your learning habits.

Description: The Pokemanki add-on will keep you motivated to use Anki by letting you catch and train Pokemons inside your deck. It gives you a hatchable Pokemon egg for each lowest-level deck that you start learning. Your Pokemon will keep on leveling up as you review and learn the cards in the deck. They might even evolve.

  

You can access your Pokemons under your Stats screen. They will be above all your figures and charts. You will be able to see Pokemons for specific decks and their origin. Just review the deck to keep on training them.

Description: Kittens rule the internet, and they have taken over Anki decks as well. Kitten Rewards is an Anki add-on which acts as an excellent learning motivator. This add-on has a simple concept: it adds a "cute kitten" on the congrats screen after a deck is finished. So if you lack motivation to study, use this add-on to get back on track.

  

What's more? You can upload your own kitten pictures as well :)

Description: Anki fanfare is another cool add-on if you want to add a particular theme to your flashcard review. For example, there’s a trout theme and a Bruce Lee theme. The trout theme shows pictures of trout, and the Bruce Lee theme shows you sayings from the Master. Be like water?

  

It has so many themes that you can use with your cards. Simply download a particular theme and unzip it to "fanfare/user_files".

  

Users have reviewed this add-on writing that they get a "dopamine hit" every time they finish a card.

Description: A little RPG magic always does the trick. No, we are not talking about Skyrim — you might never do any learning around Skyrim. But this little RPG integrated into the Anki software can take you a long way when it comes to finding a little motivation while reviewing those cards.

  

Anki Habitat is supported across platforms. It works by adding points to your [Habitica stats](https://habitica.com/static/home) as you progress through your cards. With these points added to your Habitica character, you can battle your friends and slay monsters.

  

It's a really cool add-on if you already use Habitica. If not, give it a try and motivate yourself to achieve your goals. Over 2,000,000 people are having fun through Habitica while achieving their goals.

Description: The Batch Editing add-on for Anki adds a new menu item to the card browser, which allows you to do two things: Batch-add information/media to a specific field, batch-replace the contents of any particular field.

  

The changes that you make are applied to all selected notes that are featured in the field.

### <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1496166067">Night Mode</a>

  

Updates: Regular

  

Popularity: Very popular (383 upvotes - I mean, seriously, who doesn’t love night mode?)

  

<img class="img-fluid border" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A0CvRPNWwemX65-lcw-n-_yQfzbqcTkXkctPInMNtuHDcAP2lMqBuqHAsV0uo3SbX0H_uOASDu90eF6LEB1uchgvVydUzU3OehpHv2SdzF8Avo0nOcMtLo4DwfV9neLJvkgOid1a">

  

Description: The history of night modes can be traced back to Windows Phone 7. The feature was added to the now-dead OS to reduce battery consumption as entirely black pixels didn't emit any light on OLED screens. Since then, night mode as a feature in apps and software has come a long way.

  

It's one the best Anki add-ons for medical students as they can recharge their deck review (even at night) by modifying Anki to having an all-black background. The add-on gives you the option to automatically (timer) or manually turn on the night mode. You can even invert colors of images or latex formulas and define custom color substitution rules.

Description: If you need some rigorous learning done through Anki, then you might as well use some colors. You must know that the Anki's deck page has buttons defined as 'Good', 'Easy', and 'Again' to update the time between iterations on a card.

  

This add-on only imitates the impact of colors on humans: red is known to pose a bit of danger, and you are good to go when things are green. This add-on makes the "Good" button green and the "Again" button red.

  

"I'm a simple man. I see colours, I click like." — add-on review.

Description: Medical studies require a high amount of focus. There are so many new terms coming in, and you wouldn't want to entertain any distractions as you try to get through them.

  

This add-on does what it says — it adds F11 key binding so that you can toggle full screen on Anki. You can also find this feature in the Tools menu. With this add-on at hand, you can cast all the distractions aside.

Description: The whole point of Anki is to make memorization more efficient. Now imagine this: you plan out your cards, add images, and at the review time, you realize that the pictures are too small or big.

  

With the ImageResizer add-on, you can resize all the images to the desired format and make sure that the image size is not a problem anymore. To change the shortcut and the size of the photos you are using, click on Tools, and then go to ImageResizer.

Description: Have you ever had to remember body parts from an image? Probably… :) A quick and effective way to remember these names is by hiding parts of an image in your card and then testing your knowledge of that hidden information.

  

The Occlusion Enhanced Addon is designed to do just that. You can use it to memorize things better by hiding labels in a diagram, and then revealing them. The cards generated under this add-on are described as 'mage-based cloze-deletions'.
