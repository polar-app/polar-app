## 2 Options to highlihgt - Text highlights & Area highlights

Polar supports both text highlights and area highlights.

#### Text Highlight

There are two ways to create a text highlight. The most efficient way is to go into Highlight mode.

Select a color in the top right corner of the highlight bar and left click on the text you want to highlight. You can also click ( v ) to enter highlight mode (you find all shortcuts by clicking on the “?” button on the bottom left).

Any highlight you create will now appear in the sidebar on the right of the reader.

Alternatively, you can highlight text by just selecting it without highlight mode and choosing a color for the highlight. You can also select a highlight by just pressing anymore from 1 to 6 and it'll pick the respective color.

### Do more with your highlights

Once you have created a highlight, there are multiple ways to work with it. Once you create a highlight, you will see the highlight bar on top of the highlight. This provides you various options to work with the text, from changing highlight color, adding notes, to creating flashcards automatically. All features can be accessed via shortcuts: changing colors (1 - 6), edit highlight ( e ), comment ( c ), create manual flashcard ( f ), create automatic flashcard ( g ), tag ( t ), copy text ( ctrl c ), and delete (d or delete).

### Area Highlights

Similarly, you can enter area highlight mode through the button at the top right or clicking a to create area highlights. Just drag the area you want the area highlight to capture. You can also create an area highlight by right clicking anywhere in the file and clicking ‘create area highlight’.

You can delete it in your annotation list on the right or by right-clicking on your area highlight and selecting “delete area highlight”.

You can edit your area highlight in your annotation list on the right. Here you can jump to the specific annotation, comment your highlight, create a flashcard, change your annotation colour, tag the highlight or delete it if you want to.

### Your annotations and where to find them

You can view your highlights and annotations either in your sidebar in a document or in your annotation viewer. You can access your annotation viewer by clicking on the Annotation Viewer button in the left side navigation.
