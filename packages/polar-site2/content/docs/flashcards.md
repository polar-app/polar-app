## Flashcards

### How to create flashcards in Polar
    
You can easily create flashcards by clicking the flash icon in the toolbar of an annotation. Your annotation will automatically be used as the back (answer) of the flashcard with the front empty for you to fill out. However, you can edit both sides of the card.
