# Getting Started

Polar is an advanced document management and knowledge repository for students, knowledge professionals, and self-learners.

It includes tools to manage documents annotations, and simplify learning from digital sources. It includes flashcards and incremental reading powered by spaced repetition.

# Document Repository

Your starting point in Polar is the document repository.

This holds all your reading in one place (epub, pdf, webpages), supports tags, folders, filtering for flagged or archived documents, etc.

You can also sort by any column to build reading queues and mix and match the above to build customize your repository.

# Annotation Viewer

When reading your documents with Polar you can create highlights, comment on highlights, (text & area highlights), annotate them, and manage them
using the annotation viewer. The annotation viewer captures your highlights and annotations from all files.

Like the document repository, the annotation viewer allows you to filter the view, sort by columns, etc.
