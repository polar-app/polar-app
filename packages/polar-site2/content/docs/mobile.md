# Mobile

Polar supports all functionality on mobile devices. This includes managing your reading, mobile reading, and reviewing annotations and flashcards.

# Progressive Web Application

Polar mobile can be used (and installed) by just visiting the site and logging into the web application on your mobile
device.

Polar's native Android and iOS apps are in the works and will be released in the near future. In the meantime, you can use Polar as a "progress web application" (PWA)
that can be installed just like any local app.

Both iOS and Android support PWAs and can be installed by clicking "Add to Home" after you've loaded the
app on your mobile device.

For iOS (iPhone) you will have to install via Safari and on Android you will have to install via Google Chrome.
