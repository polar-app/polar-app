# Device Sync

All your files are stored in the cloud and automatically synced across devices, as long as an internet connection exists. Polar can still be used when offline. Changes will be synced once connected to the internet again.

## 3rd Party Sync

Polar oes not yet support 3rd party syncing like Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. 3rd party sync is already on the roadmap.
