# Reporting Bugs

Get hit with a bug and want to get it fixed?  

Well good news because we love fixing bugs even more than creating them!

Here's the best way to get it a fix from the Polar team!

## Reaching out on Discord

We have a public Discord chat community which all the Polar developer listen to:

Polar supports the ability to record a video in-app and send it directly to the team.

## Sending Logs

More complicated bugs might need a copy of your logs (which might have an error).

You can go to: "Settings" | "View Device Info" | "Logs" then click "Copy to
Clipboard" and send them to the Polar team.
