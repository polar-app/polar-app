# Integrated Reader

Polar has an integrated reader for all uploaded documents. The reader supports EPUBs, PDFs, and webpages (captured through the Chrome extension). Any annotation, highlight, or comment created in Polar is captured into your repository.

# Annotation Sidebar

The annotation sidebar in the document reader shows a list of highlights, comments and
flashcards associated with a specific document.

This allows you to create, edit, tag, and delete annotations for a specific document
and view all annotations in one central location.

To view your annotations across all documents, use the annotation viewer in Polar.
