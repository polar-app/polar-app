Abstract
Objectives
The primary objective of this trial was to assess safety and anti-inflammatory effects of an
add-on training program involving breathing exercises, cold exposure, and meditation in
patients with axial spondyloarthritis
Methods
This study was an open-label, randomised, one-way crossover clinical proof-of-concept
trial. Twenty-four patients with moderately active axial spondyloarthritis(ASDAS >2.1) and
hs-CRP �5mg/L were included and randomised to an intervention (n = 13) and control
group (n = 11) group that additionally received the intervention after the control period. The
intervention period lasted for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was safety, secondary end-
points were change in hs-CRP, serum calprotectin levels and ESR over the 8-week period.
Exploratory endpoints included disease activity measured by ASDAS-CRP and BASDAI,
quality of life (SF-36, EQ-5D, EQ-5D VAS), and hospital anxiety and depression (HADS).
Results
We found no significant differences in adverse events between groups, with one serious
adverse event occurring 8 weeks after end of the intervention and judged ‘unrelated’. During

quartile range] to 16 [9–26.5] to 9 [5–23] mm/hr, p = 0.040, whereas no effect was found in
the control group (from 14 [8.3–27.3] to 16 [5–37] m/hr, p = 0.406). ASDAS-CRP declined
from 3.1 [2.5–3.6] to 2.3 [1.9–3.2] in the intervention group (p = 0.044). A similar trend was
observed for serum calprotectin (p = 0.064 in the intervention group versus p = 0.182 in the
control group), but not for hs-CRP.
Conclusions
This proof-of-concept study in axial spondyloarthritis met its primary endpoint with no safety
signals during the intervention. There was a significant decrease in ESR levels and ASDAS-
CRP upon the add-on training program in the intervention group. These findings warrant
full-scale randomised controlled trials of this novel therapeutic approach in patients with
inflammatory conditions.

Introduction
Previous research in healthy individuals exposed to experimental endotoxemia showed that
the innate immune response can be voluntarily modulated by a training program involving
breathing exercises, exposure to cold and meditation (further referred to as: ‘add-on training
program’).[1,2] Practicing the techniques learned in the add-on training program induced
intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia, as well as profoundly increased plasma epi-
nephrine levels, indicating activation of the sympathetic nervous system. These changes corre-
lated with increased plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and attenuated
levels of pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 during experimental
endotoxemia.[2]
The study of Kox et al[2] evaluated short term effects of this add-on training program in a
controlled experimental model of acute inflammation in healthy individuals. It is unknown
whether the same intervention could potentially lead to suppression of inflammation in
patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. And, more importantly, it is not known whether
this training program can safely be applied in patients with a chronic inflammatory disorder.
We designed a proof of concept (PoC) trial aimed to assess whether this well-defined add-
on training program could modulate innate immune responses in a prototypical chronic
inflammatory disease. We selected axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)[3] as model disease since
this chronic rheumatic inflammation of the spine a) involves altered innate immune
responses,[4, 5] b) affects mainly young adults with few comorbidities and concomitant medi-
cation, allowing for an unbiased efficacy and safety assessment, and c) persists often for years
as stable mild-to-moderate disease. Despite recent advances in therapeutic options for axSpA
it is still not possible to sufficiently control disease activity in all patients, as only 60–70% of the
patients respond to treatment, of whom 30% only partially. Remission is only achieved in 20%
of the patients. This indicates a clear opportunity for additional treatment options, such as the
add-on training program, to improve the outcome in these patients.
Add-on training program in axial spondyloarthritis
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225749 December 2, 2019 2 / 11This study addresses the following primary research question: Can this add-on training
program safely be applied in patients with active axial spondyloarthritis? C- reactive protein
(CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and calprotectin levels are evaluated as secondary
biological endpoints to investigate potential impact on inflammatory response. The explor-
atory outcomes are other inflammatory markers and the patient-reported outcomes
ASDAS-CRP, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), quality of life
measures (SF-36, EQ-5D, EQ-5D VAS), and hospital anxiety and depression (HADS). As this
is the first study to investigate the safety and efficacy of this intervention in patients with a
chronic inflammatory disease, we did not attempt to decipher the mechanism of action of the
add-on training program.
Methods
Study design
The study design used for this proof-of-concept trial was an open-label randomised one-way
crossover design to rule out regression to the mean (S1 Fig). This intervention is not suitable
to compare to a genuine placebo effect. A concealed computer-based system randomised par-
ticipants to an early intervention group or late intervention group in a 1:1 ratio. Stratification
was performed for duration of disease and disease activity by ASDAS-CRP.
The early intervention group started with the intervention at baseline and continued with
the intervention until week 8. Study visits in the intervention period were done at baseline,
week 4 and week 8. Sixteen weeks after the intervention period, thus at week 24, a follow-up
visit was done. The total study duration for the early intervention group was 24 weeks, in
which 4 study visits were done.
The late intervention group started with the control period that lasted for 8 weeks. Study
visits were performed at baseline, week 4 and week 8. After 8 weeks, the late intervention
group started with the intervention and continued with the intervention for 8 weeks. The week
8 visit of the control period also served as the baseline visit for the intervention period. Study
visits in the intervention period for the late control group were done after 4 and 8 weeks of
intervention (thus at week 12 and week 16). Sixteen weeks after the intervention period, thus
at week 32, a follow-up visit was done. The total study duration for the late intervention group
was 32 weeks, in which 6 study visits were done.
Data from the first 8 weeks of study participation of the late intervention group were used
as control data. Data from both intervention periods (of the early and late intervention group)
were combined in the analysis. In both groups, the 8-week intervention period was followed
by a 16-week safety follow-up period. Patients were enrolled between May and December
2016. Participating centres were the Academic Medical Centre (AMC) and Bernhoven Hospi-
tal. All training sessions took place in the AMC.
Patients
Patients aged between 18 and 55 years were eligible if they had a clinical diagnosis of axSpA
according to the treating physician, fulfilled the ASAS classification criteria[6] and had active
disease defined as ASDAS>2.1[7] and a high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) �5mg/L. Patients were
allowed to use concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids
(prednisone equivalent up to 10mg/day) and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
(DMARDs) (both synthetic and biologic) provided they have been initiated at least 8 weeks
before screening (exception: two weeks for NSAIDs) and that the dose had been stable for at
least 6 weeks prior to screening. Doses also had to remain stable throughout the study (from
screening to end of intervention at week 8). Exclusion criteria were significant comorbidities

effects for the patient, a recent history or persistence of an infection requiring hospitalization
or antibiotic treatment within 4 weeks of baseline and pregnancy.
All participants gave written informed consent. Patients received a travel allowance that
was dependent on the distance of the patients’ residence to the training site, but no other reim-
bursement. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medi-
cal Centre in Amsterdam under reference number 2015_328.
Intervention
The intervention consisted of an 8-weeks add-on training program comprising three elements:
1) breathing exercises (further detailed below), 2) gradual cold exposure (immersions in ice
cold water), and 3) meditation (third eye meditation).
The breathing techniques consisted of two exercises. First, patients were asked to hyperven-
tilate for an average of 30 breaths. Subsequently, the patient exhaled and held their breath in
an unforced manor for *2–3 min until they felt a stimulus to inhale (“retention phase”). The
duration of breath retention was entirely at the discretion of the patient himself. For safety rea-
sons, it was instructed to not hold the breath longer than 3.5 minutes. Breath retention was fol-
lowed by a deep inhalation breath, which was held for 10 s. Subsequently a new cycle of hyper/
hypoventilation began. After the last cycle, patients were instructed to do a strenuous exercise
such as push-ups. The induced state of intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia typically
“empowers” the patient to outperform their standard capability in any physical exercise. The
second breathing exercise consisted of deep inhalations and exhalations in which every inhala-
tion and exhalation was followed by breath holding for 10 s, during which the patient tight-
ened all his body muscles. An additional element this part of the training program consisted of
strength exercises (e.g., push-ups and yoga balance techniques).
During the intervention period, patients voluntarily exposed themselves to cold in two
ways. During weekly training sessions, the patients immersed whole-body in ice-cold water
(0–1 ̊C) for several minutes, incrementally up to a maximum of 5 minutes (for safety reasons).
At home, daily cold showers were taken incrementally up to 5 minutes (10–14 ̊C).
The so-called “third eye meditation,” is a form of meditation including visualizations aimed
at total relaxation. It consisted of an unguided meditation (in silence) with the eyes closed in
any posture as desired by the patient for a period of 15–20 minutes. It was generally used at the
end of each training session.
Consistent with the previous study,[2] patients were trained at the academic rehabilitation
centre by a Dutch individual Wim Hof and four trainers who previously received an instructor
course by Wim Hof to become a trainer. Medical personnel were present during all training
sessions. During the first 4 weeks, participants had group trainings twice weekly, the second 4
weeks once weekly. During the intervention period, and after extensive written and oral
instructions, participants practiced the exercises daily at home and registered their progression
in a diary. In this diary the participants reported per day a) their progression in breath reten-
tion at home and b) their mental and physical state. The adherence to the training program
was discussed and assessed weekly by the trainers and during the study visits by the medical
personnel.
Assessments
Primary safety assessments included vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram, hae-
matology and chemistry at baseline, 4, 8, and 24 weeks and upon indication, and recording of
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The number and severity of adverse

heart rate, body temperature and physical exam, were done to detect potential adverse events
that were not reported by the participants. Secondary endpoints were the change in serum hs-
CRP (mg/L) levels between baseline and week 8 of the intervention/control period as a quick
response measure, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, mm/hr) and serum calprotectin
levels[8] (measured by ELISA). Exploratory end-points were disease activity measured by
ASDAS-CRP[6] and BASDAI[9], quality of life measured by the short-form 36 (SF-36)[10]
and the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D)[11] and depressive symptoms measured by the Hospital Anxi-
ety Depression Score (HADS)[12]. All questionnaires were self-administered and used and
scored according to the test manuals.
Statistical analysis
Because of the PoC design with safety as primary outcome, sample size could not be calculated
and was estimated based on previous work[2]. All patients are included in the analysis of the
primary outcome. For the primary outcome, safety, Mann-Whitney U tests were performed.
For the secondary and exploratory outcome, a per protocol analysis was performed in which
only patients that completed the intervention period were included. For the analyses of the
intervention period, the intervention periods of the early and late intervention group were
combined. The control group consisted of the first 8 weeks of the late intervention group. Sec-
ondary and exploratory outcomes were primarily assessed within groups over the 8-week
intervention/control period using Wilcoxon signed rank tests comparing baseline and week 8.
Because of the proof-of-concept nature of this trial, we did not adjust for multiple testing. A p
value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Patient and public involvement
This intervention has received extensive media attention in the past years, resulting in patients
with various conditions practicing this intervention. However there was little known about
safety and putative immunomodulatory effects. The importance of a research project that
would increase insight into these matters was highly appreciated by patients as mentioned in
patient panels. To properly set the training program for patients with axSpA, 3 patient experts
were consulted. As their strong preference was that all patients would receive the intervention,
the study was designed as a one-way crossover open-label randomized (within-group) con-
trolled trial. The results will be disseminated to study participants by personal communication
and press release.
Results
Thirty-one patients were screened and 24 patients were randomised to either the early (n = 13)
or late intervention (n = 11) group (Fig 1). There were no statistical differences between both
groups in demographics, baseline characteristics and concomitant medication (Table 1). Two
patients in the early intervention group discontinued after 4 weeks of training: 1 because of an
adverse event (AE) and 1 because of a change in medication for a persisting arthritis. In the
control group, 3 patients discontinued after the control period (week 8). Two because of insuf-
ficient motivation for the intervention, 1 was lost to follow-up. In total 21 participants started
with the intervention, of whom 19 completed the intervention period. All 11 patients in the
late intervention group completed the control period.

No serious adverse events occurred during the intervention period. During the intervention
period, 10 participants in the intervention group reported a total of 12 AEs (2 participants
reported 2 AEs), and 7 participants of the control group reported a total of 9 AEs (2 partici-
pants reported 2 AEs)(p = 0.268). The most common AE was common cold (4 vs. 2, respec-
tively, Table 2). Three AEs during the intervention period had a moderate severity (1 in the
intervention group and 2 in the control group). During the follow-up period (n = 19), there
was one SAE of a participant who experienced a hypertensive crisis 8 weeks after end of the
intervention and was hospitalised for one night. Upon further examination by a ophthalmolo-
gist there were signs of longstanding disease, therefore this SAE was judged ‘unrelated’ to the
study procedures and did not lead to discontinuation of the study.
Secondary endpoints
All secondary endpoints are listed in Table 3. In the intervention group, ESR significantly
declined over time: from 16[9–26.5] mm/hr at baseline to 9[5–23] mm/hr at week 8, p = 0.040,
while it did not in the control group: from 14[8.3–27.3] mm/hr to 16[5–37] mm/hr, p = 0.406).

Add-on training program in axial spondyloarthritis
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225749 December 2, 2019 7 / 11Hs-CRP did not significantly change within both groups during the 8-week intervention
period (intervention group: from median [IQR] 10.2[6.5–17.1] mg/L to 6[3.9–15.6] mg/L,
p = 0.103, control group: from 8.7[5.2–17.2] mg/L to 13.2[7.9–20.1] mg/L, p = 0.286). Calpro-
tectin tended to decline in the intervention group (from 2295[1648–4923] pg/mL to 2165
[953–3734] pg/mL, p = 0.064), whereas it remained stable in the control group (2115[1300–
2571] pg/mL to 2279[1770–4989 pg/mL], p = 0.307).
Exploratory endpoints
All exploratory endpoints are listed in Table 3. There was a significant improvement in the
median ASDAS-CRP during the 8-week period in the intervention group (p = 0.044), but not
in the control group (p = 0.213). Median BASDAI declined significantly in the intervention
group (p = 0.012) but not in the control group (p = 0.755). The physical component score
(PCS) of the SF-36 increased significantly during the intervention period (p = 0.004) but not
in the control group (p = 0.859).The MCS of the SF-36 increased significantly in the interven-
tion group (p = 0.004) but not in the control group (p = 0.859).The EQ-5D did not signifi-
cantly change in the intervention group (p = 0.102) nor in the control group (p = 0.933).A
similar effect was observed for the EQ-5D VAS (p = 0.090 and p = 0.674 in the intervention
and control groups, respectively. There was no significant effect on the HADS anxiety and
depression scales within groups.
The main burden of the intervention assessed by patients themselves was the commuting
time to the academic center for group training and follow-up visits. The time spent on group
and personal trainings were assessed as purposeful and the burden of cold exposure was tran-
sient. The participation during the training sessions was judged as high by the trainers. The
adherence to the exercises at home was discussed in the group sessions and reviewed in the
diaries, and was also judged as high.
Discussion
In the present trial we show that the add-on training program involving breathing exercises,
cold exposure, and meditation can safely be applied in patients with axial spondyloarthritis, a
prototype chronic inflammatory disease.
We observed no differences in the number and severity of adverse events in the interven-
tion group compared to the control group. There was a significant decrease in ESR levels over
time in the intervention group but not in the control group. This is in line with previous work
showing that the immune response can be modulated through the add-on training program in

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225749 December 2, 2019 8 / 11healthy participants during experimental endotoxemia[2]. The intervention also tended to
result in decreased serum calprotectin levels, a validated disease activity biomarker in axSpA
[8], although this did not reach a statistical significance. Various measures of disease activity
(ASDAS-CRP, BASDAI) and quality of life (SF-36) improved following the intervention. The
effects observed in the intervention group are unlikely to be due to regression to the mean as
there were no effects in the control group. Therefore, our results are indicative that voluntary
modulation of the immune response may not only be possible in acute inflammatory response
due to microbial stimulation but also in chronic inflammation related to immune-mediated
inflammatory diseases.
This study has several limitations. 1) As this study was a proof-of-concept trial the sample
size was small and not powered to investigate efficacy. However, despite this small sample size,
significant changes in the secondary and exploratory outcomes were found. Larger follow-up
studies are required to formally assess clinical efficacy.
2) The unblinded design of the study renders our results susceptible for a placebo effect. As
the studied intervention is not suitable for a genuine placebo treatment, we chose hs-CRP, ESR
and calprotectin as a secondary biologic endpoint that does not suffer from subjective influ-
ences or variability in the measurements. Furthermore, we used a delayed intervention group
to assess the impact of regression to the mean. With this design we neutralized the aforemen-
tioned components of placebo effect. Moreover, the data obtained did not suggest an effect of
regression to the mean since we observed changes in the intervention but not in the control
group.

Add-on training program in axial spondyloarthritis
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225749 December 2, 2019 9 / 113) Our study design was not aimed at and therefore does not allow us to decipher the mech-
anism of action of this intervention. The mechanism of action behind the add-on training pro-
gram remains to be unraveled. Kox et al clearly showed the biological impact of the training
program on the innate immune response[2]. Firstly it is unknown whether it is necessary to
practice all three components of the training program, or whether the observed effect in
immune response is attained by one of the components. Secondly it is unknown what the min-
imally required intensity or duration of the training program should be to see similar results.
Future research should address these questions.
4) The adherence to the training program at home was not formally checked, although dis-
cussed weekly during the group sessions and study visits. The adherence to the group sessions
was high as on average the participants missed 1.5 out of 12 group sessions, due to holidays,
other obligations or sickness.
5) Although not a major part of the add-on training program, the strength exercises
(performed in conjunction with the breathing exercises) might play a role in the improve-
ments we found in the participants, since exercise is a pivotal part of the treatment of axial
spondyloarthritis.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the add-on training program used in
this study can safely be applied in patients with axial spondyloarthritis and potentially modu-
lates inflammatory response. These findings warrant further clinical assessment of this novel
therapeutic approach. Future research should include a larger sample size to formally evaluate
clinical efficacy and should by focussed on further elucidation of the mechanism of action of
the combined and/or individual components of the training program.
