// TODO:
//
// - should we have 'personal' accounts and company ones and differentiate?
// - does the 'domain' conflict with 'links' in the profile?
//

// - FIXME: ok.. another major probem... we should have a separate configuration
// for their education because just because they're not a student DOES NOT mean
// they lack a professional education.

// - FIXME: ok... what about self-taught people... should we allow them to specify
// an equivalent level of study?

// - FIXME: completed level of education... if only high school we will need to have
// that to and right now we only have universities.  And there isn't an 'other'
// option there either.
//
// - FIXME: if they're pursing a masters we can't assume they received an
//  undergraduate from that university for example.
//
// - FIXME: should we only have them specify their highest completed level of
//   education.
//
// - FIXME: we definitely should NOT just limit the education to not include
//   a univerÂ¡sity in the business profile.
