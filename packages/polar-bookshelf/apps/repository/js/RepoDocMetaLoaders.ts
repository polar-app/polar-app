        // locks up the UI but we also need a reasonable timeout.
        //
        // TODO: this is a tough decision as it trades throughput for latency
        // and I don't want latency in the UI.  It might be better to batch into
        // 50 items each when SENDING the events and not throttling the events
        // but throttling the actual snapshot rate.  For example, if we receive
        // a snapshot with 500 items we can just break that into say 50 items
        // each and then immediately update the UI with no trailing latency at
        // the end.  But we can throttle the actual number of snapshots so that
        // if we receive tons of snapshots with 1 item them we batch these but
        // even THEN that would add latency because we're not sure how often
        // the server is sending data.

        // TODO: it might be possible to remove the throttler AFTER we start
        // BUT I noticed that it doesn't work. The general idea is to improve
        // the latency by no longer trading latency for throughput after
        // startup but we don't have a reliable way to notify that we have
        // fully read in the main snapshot after init.  If I can do that then I
        // can disable the throttler by flipping a loaded flag but right now that
        // strategy doesn't work as once we hit 100% (which seems to happen too
        // soon) we will no longer throttle and performance will suck.
