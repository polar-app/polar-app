# Important features we should implement

- ability to temporily hide/show pagemarks so that we can click links, or
  highlight text.  It might also be ideal to have mouse events not sent to the
  pagemark element so that all of the underlying document can still be used.

- UI for capture so that you can just import a web document and open a new
  window.

- Two column pagemarks.. different type of pagemarks (ignored)

- Export to Anki

- Preserve links to youtube, etc.  View the inline or at least make them <a>
  links.

- automatic mode for highlights.  Basically, as you scroll up, everything above
  the fold gets a pagemark.
