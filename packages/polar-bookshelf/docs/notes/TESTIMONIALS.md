@IcyPalm: I am so incredibly impressed with your project! Currently writing
the last pieces of my thesis so using it for studying is just too late for me.
However, I am recommending Polar to all the students I currently teach in the
lower years and they Love it! It is currently very basic and simple but it has
such incredible potential!
