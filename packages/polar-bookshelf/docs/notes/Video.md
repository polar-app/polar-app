- I want polar to support video.  It just make sense as this is a piece of 
  complex media too.

- put the pagemark bar at the top of the page

- implement a feature for annotating the video as it's playing 

- pagemarks would be seen marks in this scenario and we would keep track of where
  you have seem the video
  
- pageMeta makes no sense here but it's required for the model and I might want 
  to change it.

- I think we might want to 'slice' the video into video chunks and maybe consider
  these 'like' pages and then create marks on them as we're reading them. 
  
    - Maybe I could map these to 'pageMeta'.
    
- the comments would go into those time chunks as would the flashcards.  We 
  could use the sidebar annotation UI for them and just put it in reverse
  order at the bottom of the video.         

- there's actually an API for this...
