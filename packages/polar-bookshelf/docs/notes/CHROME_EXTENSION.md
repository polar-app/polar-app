# Features

- Capture ALL tabs.. not just one.

    This would have come in handy when capturing ALL these pages...

- Capture directly in the browser.  The dependent resources can bet fetches
  externally.  One issue though is can I emulate a device in a tab?  I probably
  can...

# Code

- take the code form Horizon and use it as the core extension base.
