- since it supports every platform (linux, mac, windows) you can move to any OS
  you want.  You can have it for 30 years.  If Windows dies out.. or Mac... it 
  doesn't matter.
  
- PDFs will be around forever.  HTML too.

- goals:

    - LONG TERM retension of vast amounts of material

    - discovery and collaboration among people researching the same material

    - work with mobile devices
        - mobile should be review-only
        - reading is done on a tablet , laptop , or PC
            - it's just far too difficult to interact with a mobile device

    - manage what you're reading with a tag UI

    - document collaboration is done via document hash and fingerprint, NOT via URL

        - allows for two people to collaborate on teh same "content" even if it
          is hosted on a 3rd party URL, mirror like the Internet Archive,
          filecoin, etc.

- spaced repition

    - when consuming material the main problem is retention
    - chart of retention falloff
    -

- incremental reading

   - suspend and resume

   - pagemarks
        - keep track of reading positions with suspend+resume

- annotations

    - distributed annotations help users collaborate on material
    - the data this provides can build very powerful machine learning models.
         - for example we can build deriviative highlights from content based
           on the number of highlights to prioritize important excerpts in the
           source material.  We can then  use this to build enhanced cards.

    - provide key markup that enables incremental reading + spaced repitition


   - text highlights
        - highlight source content
        - add flashcards to the source content
        - sync to mobile devices

   - area highlights

- improving metadata on cards.

- full text search

- labels and tagging
    - my tagfs ideas for unions and derived labels (compsci is linux + microsoft)
    - search by domain or site too.  automatic tags
    - tag values site:microsoft.com
    -

- sharing within groups/companies/universities

- flashcards

- spaced repetition

- incremental reading

- PDF + HTML  + docbook

- x-ray support whereby I can turn on and turn off the underlying annotations

- I can use near-duplicate detection to find documents that share a high degree
  of text between them to better support threading

- different levels of highlights controlled by the maximum number you want... so
  say 10 per page to begin with, then 20, etc. Threading on the side like genius.

- gamification
    - how much did you read per day.
    - github style productivity stats
    - stats per topic
- sharing
    - annotations, highlights shared
    - viewable across the web via our extension. Shown inline and with a
      dedicated sidebar app
- what requires the chrome extension?

- content is extracted as text snippets, highlights, thumbnails, etc.  You can
  keep it long term.

- create managed reading queues that are more derivatives of tags and control
  the priority of them based on last updated time and / or progress or importance
  tags.

- metadata docinfo editor...

    - work on a way for users to set the metadata for their documents.

#

- integrates into version control.. just commit
- screenshots are part of annotations
- text and html are part of annotations
- hackable... REST API and chrome platform.
