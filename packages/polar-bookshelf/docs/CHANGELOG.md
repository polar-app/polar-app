- GA events for cloud login and configured 

- User-Agent was not being properly tracked and this as very important to detect
  which Operating Systems were being used.

- Fixed problem with constraining the window sizes on smaller displays like                                                                                        rep
  smaller laptops.

  this release. 

# 1.13.2

- more tour changes

# 1.13.0

- Tour of how to use Polar for new users.

- Replaced the context menu with a native React menu. 

# 1.12.1

- If we are given a path to a file during the writeFile datastore operation, we
  hard link it instead of copying it.  This is only done with file paths 
  (not data blobs) and works during PDF file import to avoid duplicate disk 
  space usage.   

- re-importing an existing file should now open it in polar instead of doing 
  nothing. 

- starting work to disabled updates for MS and Apple stores.  

- adding some newlines between markdown exported entries.

- Updated windows build with new icons. 

# 1.12.0

- Feature: Properly keep track of reading progress and update the reading
  progress metrics now.

- Feature: Ability to set the 'mode' for pagemarks now so that we can keep track
  of reading progress better.  We support various pagemark modes like read, 
  previously-read, table of contents, etc. 

- Feature: site (example.com) is now a column which you can add to the doc repo
  but isn't enabled by default.  This is used for captured content.  We may
  add this for other types of content in the future including PDFs if we can 
  get proper URLs for the content in the future.

- Feature: Double click on the pagemark progress bar now jumps to the last pagemark. This
  has been frequently requested but more specifically to have it automatically
  jump to the last position.  I'm not able to implement the automatic portion
  right away so this is a temporary work around.  My plan is to eventually put
  a button and a right click context menu when I rework some of the viewer 
  support to React.

- Feature: Now parse DOIs from PDFs and store them in the model.  This feature
  isn't really used yet but we plan to add support for fetching additional 
  metadata based on the DOI

- Feature: More descriptive text for the assignment and filtering of documents
  around tags to avoid confusing the user around creating vs filtering of tags. 
  Might still have to improve the UX here.

- Bug: Rework the way we do app exit which hopefully fixes windows bugs and
  exception on exit.

- Verified Electron 4.0.3 mostly works with Polar but only using 3.1.3 due to 
  a bug with resizing / pagemarks. 

- Bug: Logging out of cloud sync makes it impossible to login back again. #536

# 1.11.0

- more consistent header bar throughout the app.

- Pagemark batches which help working with PDFs that have multiple pages.  Now
  if you create pagemarks across pages you can delete one and the whole batch 
  is also deleted.

- Reworked analytics.  I'm expecting a 2x falloff on this release I think. 

- Fixed bug with page zoom not working properly in the HTML viewer.  The zoom 
  now works but pagemarks still aren't placed properly.

- Page number in markdown export

- Disabled the top message boxes.  They were annoying and only a stop gap until
  we have a proper onboarding mechanism.  I

- Electron 3.1.2

- Donate and Discord buttons in header.  These are important.

- Setting POLAR_DISABLE_HARDWARE_ACCELERATION should disable hardwawre 
  acceleration now if that's causing a problem for you.

# 1.10.0

- Fixed sync bug related to not sending data to the cloud but I don't think this
  was actually released.

- Fixed bug with promises not being resolved and the viewer not being updated
  but I don't think this was actually released.

- Feature: Migrated to fixed nav header

- Feature: GDPR notice in place.

- Feature: Shift selects a range of documents, control selects one document at a
  time for multiple documents at once.

- Feature: Implemented a basic exporter framework.  Annotations can now be
  exported from the sidebar.  Exporting will be improved over time with more
  features.

- Bug: Fixed (I hope) long standing ugly bug of 'crash' of Electron on app exit due
  to windows not being destroyed via destroy().  Close does not release the 
  resources properly.  

- Bug: Fixed bug where long titles in URLs could generate filenames that were too
  long and couldn't be represented on the filesystem.  We not truncate at 50 
  chars.

- Feature: New buttons for '+ Add' to import from disk or capture web page. 
  Much easier to determine how to add content to polar.

- Feature: multi-select and ability to tag multiple docs at once.

- Feature: Sorting by tags is now much better and actually works.  If you double
  click the sort column it will show you untagged documents sorted by the time
  they were added.

- Dependencies: Update to electron 3.1.1 

- Bug: Fixed bug where hitting Enter when working with a title would cause the
  page to reload.

# 1.9.0

- Create pagemark to point now works across multiple pages and ranges.  

- Fixed bad bug where the UI wouldn't update when a newly imported PDF wasn't
  immediately visible in the UI.

  This was a bad initial user experience as they would have to reload for the
  PDFs to be visible.

- Fixed major Twitter content capture bug where we weren't saving the CSS styles
  of HTML content.

- Fixed bug where VH rules that were less than 100 weren't being set properly 
  and some pages rendered ugly.

- Fixed bug with the 'deck:' tag not properly working with Anki sync.

- Importing large numbers of PDFs (and large PDFs) is now a lot faster and more
  responsive when using cloud storage.  In the past we used to wait until the 
  cloud layer was finished but this takes a long time to complete.

- Now using 'localhost' instead of 'localapp.getpolarized.io' for the hostname.
  Some users weren't able to resolve this (not sure why) and additionally 
  working offline didn't function either.

# 1.8.0

Major changes:

- PDFs auto-import when trying to share them from the browser.

- Refactored the rich text editor so the bar at the top is no longer in 'air' 
  mode so that users can realize that it supports rich text.

- support for cloze deletion

- Stats view for core stats  

- New logs view to show logs as they're being written which can help users 
  debug issues with Polar and report problems to the dev team plus understand
  what's happening with their data.

- Related tags in the tag selector

- 'capturing' a PDF from the browser now works and the PDF is then saved into 
  the repository.

- Copy URL to clipboard shows toaster that the URL was copied successfully.

- Reveal file in finder (or Explorer on Windows) 

- Copy file path to clipboard.

# 1.7.0

- New annotations view to see all your annotations in one place.

- New sidebar to expand contract to show other pages within polar 

- New option to create a pagemark at the mouse point.  Still more work to make
  the key bindings visible.

- Adding forced CSS for ::selection so that sites that have broken CSS for 
  highlighting don't actually break polar and we also have consistent highlight
  support.

- Fixed some navigational issues in the web capture system. 

- Fixed bug the annotation bar in PDF where resize will kill it.  Hopefully the 
  last bug there.

- Backend changes to support cloze deletions in anki.

# 1.6.0

- Fixed possible regression due to using SVG icons as these broke the app repo
  and possibly a few other issue.

- Re-add uncaught exception handlers on app exit.  Hope to fix the issues we were
  having with exceptions on app exit.

- Completely new annotation bar for highlighting which should fix a major bug 
  with the PDF mode.

- Fixed some fonts + css with the sidebar.

- Improved indeterminate progress bar on MacOS and just better in general 

- Print the version numbers for updates.

- Fixed quote mangling due to improper UTF-8 handling.  

- Hopefully fixed high CPU bug on Windows caused by shutdown and attempting to 
  double-close windows. 
 
- Sending analytics for number of invitations sent

- Implemented Control+Enter for creating comments.  

- Making tags + updated + added columns visible by default for new users.   
  I think some people did not discover it by default.

# 1.5.1

- change the button color of the capture button so that it's obvious what to 
  click for new users

- hopefully/finally fixed issue with the annotation popup bar in PDFs. 

- tab keyboard nav works for flashcards

- control+enter works to create flashcards

- control+enter works for tag input

# 1.5.0

- Cloud sync implemented based on Firebase.

- Fixed issue with highlighter popup becoming disabled with PDF.

- Dozens of other smaller features and fixes integrated.  This is a big release.

# 1.1.1 

- Fixed bug with not loading all documents properly on startup.

# 1.1.0

- New Splash system to keep customers engaged with Polar growth and marketing.
  We only display a few messages and only on startup. I don't want these to be 
  annoying. 

- Tested to verify the published chrome URL works with the version of Chrome we
  are about to ship.

- Support for our new chrome extension.

- Disabling amp for now until we have a better solution on how to show the user
  that an AMP page is displayed and how to disable / enable it.  Otherwise its
  confusing and often the amp page is WORSE not better.

- Fixed bugs with the browser size not changing during capture browser changing
  and also fixed some issues with it not properly accepting the browser change 
  in some situations.  

- Fixed bug in HTML zoom where the page would be truncated improperly.

- Blocked amp ads during the capture but they aren't blocked during the preview 
  at the moment.

- "Fixed" nasty anti-aliasing bug in electron by blocking amp ads. They were 
  annoying anyway but for some reason they were breaking chrome rendering - 
  probably due to some web component nonsense.   

- Implemented a new strategy with the vertical height algorithm in the capture 
  system to revert it back to auto instead of a fixed max-height.  Works a lot
  better now.  

- Date/times no longer include ' ago' to be a bit more concise.

- Basic initial version of AppPath which can be used to load apps via HTTP now.

- The data transfer from the disk store to the firebase store works which means
  we're very close to having a full cloud implementation of sync.

- Made the VH 100 fix for capture more picky 

- Added small FAQ entry to enable Anki sync.

- Fixed a bug where we could select text and not properly work with elements.

- Renderer analytics didn't understand that a callback without an error wasn't 
  a failure.
  
- Upgraded a number of important react packages:

    react react-dom react-moment react-select @types/react-table 
    @types/react-select @types/react @types/prop-types @types/node-fetch

- removed inversify package (were not using it)

- latest fontawesome

- fixed issue with electron-builder where it was forcing us to upgrade to the 
  latest version for each release. 

# 1.0.14

- Upgrade to latest semver and firebase-tools 

- Fixed bug where the lightbox was kept enabled after we deleted an annotation

- We can now capture a new class of documents that use a vertical height on 
  their CSS selectors. 

- We can now capture XML documents which used XSL stylesheets.

- Major refactor of the disk datastore for the pending cloud sync functionality
  we're working on. 

# 1.0.13

 - point release to fix auto-updates in release process and upgrade 
   electron-builder and electron-updater

   electron-builder

# 1.0.12

- Reduced the minimum mouse click duration required for bringing up the annotation 
  bar. 

- Fixed bug with Electron generating an error window on exit due to a conversion 
  of the wrong type to an integer.  This was/is an Electron bug.  This may not

- Upgrade to Electron 3.0.8

- Fixed analytics around number of documents in the repository

# 1.0.11

- release to fix MacOS certificate bugs

# 1.0.10

- banner message about opencollective donations

- Change capture key binding to CommandOrControl+N (new).  The other key binding 
  conflicted with window management in Chrome and we might want to use those
  key bindings in the future.

- STASH files can be added directly as a backend file just like images and video
  which means that they could work with the future firebase store.  

- refactored the way we're handling popups for the annotation bar.  I think this
  will resolve most of the issues we're having but there are still a few more 
  glitches to be fixed.  

- If any of the input tags were invalid, they were ALL ignored.  Which is bad.

- Fixed ugly bug where percentags can be > 100% but only slightly.

- reworked the preview browser so that buttons are only enabled after you first
  load a URL so that it's not confusing for the user.

# 1.0.9

- release to fix MacOS release breakage.

# 1.0.8

- ability to enable fetching the auto-update from a pre-release

- the capture preview now expands the content once it's loaded.  One issue here 
  is that some documents appear too long.  I think it is an issue with computing
  the scroll height reliably and I'm still figuring this part out. 

- when capture preview is running we now set a title

# 1.0.7

- another release to fix Windows by upgrading sentinel

# 1.0.6

- changes to analytics and a rapid release for fixing Windows. 


# 1.0.5 

- more browsers for larger documents (desktop).

    - delete text annotation
    - menu for text-annotation to create flashcard + comment

- Capture now has a key binding: CommandOrControl+Shift+W

- Text highlights no longer being saved to JSON.. migrating them to the file 
  repo...

# 1.0.4

- Tags are stored with anki notes now.  They weren't before but they're critical
  to making our anki support work better. 

- We now have a basic but imperfect settings systems that allows us to persist
  various changes locally .. Will need to be refactored a bit in the future to
  make it more MVC and to work better with react.

- nr of annotations column to show / highlight documents which are annotated
  most.

- tags column which isn't enabled by default.

- improve double click handling to make sure we have a set of isolated single 
  click columns.

- merged PR from xuebingli to handle double click on columns intended to be 
  single click. 

    https://github.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/pull/303

- Fixed a bug where some pages weren't properly expanding when they were first
  loaded. 

- Fixed GA tracking of events which weren't sending before. Need this to 
  determine which features are being used.   

- Ability to click on the pulldown in the document repository to the right and 
  copy the URL for a document that was captured.

- Fixed bug where capture wouldn't generate a completely unique URL for storage
  on the file system and if you captured two URLs with the same title the 
  later one would update the former one.  We now include the a hash prefix of
  the SHA384 in the filename for uniqueness.

# 1.0.3

- Put ToS, cookie policy, and privacy policy in the about links so that people
  can get access to these easily.

- Super fast double click on text no longer brings up the annotation box.  Only
  more explicit highlights where the suer drags their mouse.

- Webaudio is enabled now. I had disabled it before as it's annoying when
  capture is running but we need it for video support to work properly.  

- PHZ files were not actually being compressed. Just stored.  Weird bug with 
  the API in jszip which made it easy to accidentally disable compression.  
  PHZ files will be 3x smaller in this release.    

- Upgraded to the latest sentry. I think there snap bug is related to sentry 
  but I'm not sure yet.  The snap packages weren't working but maybe they will
  in this release. 

- Upgraded to latest packages:
    - firebase
    - react
    - split.js
    - reactstrap

- Anki now properly uses the deck: tag when writing to decks.

- Initial support for Youtube video embeds.  We had NO support for youtube in 
  the past so even though this is minimal it's better than what we currently 
  have.

# 1.0.2

- The delete document prompt now has a subtitle to note that you will also lose
  the annotations.

- Border around the webview so you can see which part of the page is the doc.

- On OS X it's common to re-create a window in the app when the
  dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open. The way
  we handle this now is that if there are no windows open we re-create
  the document repository so they can select one. Otherwise we just
  re-focus the most recently used window.

- Deleting documents in the UI app repository is implemented.

- Deleting documents from the repository via API is implemented.

- Upgrade to latest reactstrap 

- Show the data dir path when loading help | about so that people can easily
  figure out where their data is being stored.

- Ability to set titles for documents in the doc repository

- Using Electron 3.0.4

# 1.0.1

- This build should make manual auto-updates work. 

- Fixed a bug with some PDFs not opening properly

- Fixed bug with split.js by upgrading and also fixed some issues with rendering
  the page initially with split.js which caused it to re-snap and re-center
  itself.

# 1.0.0

- calling this version 1.0.0.  We are mostly feature complete.  There are a few
  things lacking but this way we can start getting more feedback as we're very 
  stable and people shouldn't assume the app is beta just becuase we're lacking
  a few features.

- Zip target was not provided for MacOS so auto-update was not working. 
  Hopefully it will in the next release.
  
- started adding the infra to add file attachments to the store 

# 1.0.0-beta211

  I need to take the time to build them correctly.  We have tar.

- Offset given to new windows so that it's not confused with the previous window.

- Better logging for additional performance. Default log level is INFO bug we 
  can change it later to WARN.  Include the source of the log event and the log
  level in messages now.

  Browser version, app version, etc.
