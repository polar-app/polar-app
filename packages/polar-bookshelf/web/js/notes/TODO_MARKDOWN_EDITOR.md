# Overview

- design of a full markdown editor implemented in react using keyboard/mouse
  events only - NO contenteditable.



- review other threads about contenteditable.  

# TODO:
    - first fuck aorund with a textarea component / version of this.
    - 
    
# ISSUES TO AVOID
    - click selection / activation needs to blur other components
    - selection needs to be done properly
    

# Code Examples
