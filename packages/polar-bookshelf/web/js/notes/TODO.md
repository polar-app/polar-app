- if we type wiki-style syntax it's not incorporated properly
    [Canada](https://www.example.com)

    - it gets escapes as \\[foobar\\](https:///www.example.com)

- what do we do about markdown double [[]] when linking. It's not supported by ckeditor5...
    - 

- finish up the node selection action

- update 'links' as they are created including when the user completes the note manually.

- make the note name or content but not both
- ckeditor bubble mode working properly
- ckeditor classic vs bubble mode toggler
- proper arrow/tab naviation
    - when a note is empty, and you hit delete, delete the note
- when inserting an image with an HDR display, use the right dimensions.


- we need some sort of background saving function so that we're constantly persisting what the user types
  while they're using the app.... 

- undo will be required

- performance issue when going back... (maybe it's useHistory)

- proper tabbing like with workflowy

- make ckeditor tasks 

    - DONE: click on and abort clicking a link

    - DONE: editor mode vs bubble mode and the ability to switch between them
        - I *think* we can do it but not until I do a proper ckeditor build

    - Try to complete AND type the input that we're reading so that I can filter the actions the user 
      is taking
