- get the action menus to work now...

- right on an empty note doesn't work... 

- image paste handler

- enter on a note with children leaves the children behind...

- regions and multi-node selection needs to work
    - first select a region, then do multi-item select.
    - select the current note first.

- node range selection should allow us to expand and collapse as we up / down arrow

- if we have a tree like

    - hello
    - world
        -dog 
        
        
    - and we delete 'world' the 'dog' should reparent under 'hello'

- I think links like <a> need to be have 'hand' cursor when on hover and the contenteditable isn't active.
