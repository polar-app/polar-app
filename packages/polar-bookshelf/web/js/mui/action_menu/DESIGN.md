// FIXME: then hte region goes backwards, before the trigger point, close the dialog...


// FIXME: desgn, this component controls whether the auto-complete dialog pops up and that's a
// root component for auto-complete that pops up, allows us to type, and can be dismissed as
// I type.
//
// this code is given the metadata for the dialog, and the root store pops it up... and it uses
// mobx for the control / code.

// FIXME: provide ALL the data to the action including
//
// - where it should popup
// - what the title (if any) should be
// - the data provider that filters and returns the data based on the prompt
