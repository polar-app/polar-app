// TODO: I would like to resume this in the future but the design here is
// difficult:
//
// - is the Logger created with the right name if called from a function?
//   Probably not because we're looking at the calls stack and this adds another
//   frame
//
// - I could add this to Logger directly and have timed() there or create this
//   with a const at the top level FROM the log (this is probably the best
//   option) and call it something like a tracer or a tracker or a timer and
//   some of them could have more functions like one could call
//   RendererAnalytics with a timer.
//
// - I could make ALL the loggers extends BaseLogger which is an ILogger but
//   also adds this timing functinonality below.
