// FIXME: resizing doesn't work now...

-  moving elements outside the parent is possible thanks to a bug
   or lack of feature in the rect adjacency calculator..  Give it a generic
   'bounds' restriction that I can work with.



- move ALL the code into a 'draggable' or other package.

- disable all the logging
