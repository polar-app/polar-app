The main site is located here:

https://github.com/burtonator/polar-site/tree/master/

You would want to edit this file:

https://github.com/burtonator/polar-site/blob/master/index.html

You can just search for the text you want to edit and use the HTML markup properly.

It will get released when we update the site or you can just tell me and I'll push it.
