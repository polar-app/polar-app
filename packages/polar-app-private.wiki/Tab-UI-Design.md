- all tabs should have the same width and shrink like the way chrome does
    - so ... we can't do this right now.  not sure why.
- context menu supported so we can right click
- key binding to bring up a preview of the available tabs
- we need key bindings for the MAIN tabs.  
- close button on tabs when we hover over them 


TODO: 
 - what do we do about the main tabs getting killed?
