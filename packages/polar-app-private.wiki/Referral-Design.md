# Overview

Basic / first pass implementation of referrals.

# On signup 

User is given 10 points which they can use to 'buy' polar premium for a trial. It's basically a full free month.

# Sharing referral




## Trial Plans

# TODO

- tech: how do we setup 'trial' plans

    - setup on the backend via a cloud function.  The function also needs to look at a 'has_trial' to verify that the
      user hasn't already had a trial OR we just give them points and they can 'activate' polar premium
  
    - give a user 10 points on int of the profile so they can buy their own plan to start their 'trial'...
