# Overview

Basic / first pass implementation of referrals.

# Sharing referral codes

There is a new page at /invite that the user will be shown that they can use to trigger sending a message.

On this page they can:

- paste in a list of emails.  The backend will send then an email with a referral code
    - TODO: this has not yet been implemented on the backend.
- copy the link, with referral code so that the user can send it themselves.
- send via twitter button (automatically triggers twitter share)
- send via facebook button (automatically triggers facebook share)
- use the mobile 'send' feature to trigger sending a message when using their mobile device

In the future we can extend this to support more APIs like accessing their gmail contacts.

# Triggering the referral code on signup

This referral link will:

- load app.getpolarized.io

- save the referral code into the browser

- redirect to a landing page saying that if they signup now they get a free month of polar on top of their existing 
  trial month (2 months)
  
... 30 days later:

- upon signin, if the user has a referral that hasn't been granted (and has aged 30 days and has been active)

    - automatically give both the referrer, and referee, free 30 days of polar by
        - calling the stripe coupon API to give them one month of their current plan
        
# Trials and Rewarding Points

There will be two ways of rewarding points:

- if they are approaching the end of a trial , but they are a referral, we
        
- FIXME: do the grant when their trial is about to expire?  This is probably the best way to do things as we 
  would be within a function ANYWAY and they just get to continue using polar for another 60 days.        
        
- FIXME: I think for TRIAL users with a referral, they should just be given a longer trial, it's easier because capturing
  the credit card at that point, might be harder.      
        
# Messages

- send the referee an email that one of their users has signed up and that they will be given a free month 
  once their referred user has aged for 30 days.
        
- 
        
# Notes

- I think it should always just be 'one month of bronze'.  This way:

    - It's standardized for .edu pricing as well.  If they're 19.95 per month for bronze we just give them a credit
      of $19.95 / 12
          
    - It's standardized across currencies:
        - If they purchase in INR we give them the equivalent of INR bronze at one month. 

    - It's standardized across plans.  If they purchase gold, they won't get a full month of gold for one referral.  They 
      would need 2-3.
    
- We can convert this to points later if we want.  It's just that 10 points would equal "one month bronze" and converted
  to the users currency.

- The reward will be triggered automatically.  Right now this is slightly easier as I don't need to build a points 
  system or a UI to redeem points.  The users are just given the coupon via stripe.  

- We can give them ways to earn points later including by sharing their documents, and flashcards publicly... 

## Trial Plans

- Trials will be triggered via stripe subscription trials.  They will last 30 days and they will not require a credit 
  card

 - https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials
 
    - use stripe trials for this... it's easy and we only have to implement one endpoint I think.

## TODO

- the referred user basically gets a full month extra in their trial... when they are ready.

- how do we handle granting referrals to new users and handle trials.

    - the main issue is that we would need to capture credit card details and UNTIL they have given us credit card 
      details we're not really certain they are 'converted' users...  

- we do NOT want to automatically grant them at 27 days because they might be idle users... we would have to make
  sure they are really / truly active
  
- write to a 'heartbeat' table?

## Questions

- I don't think they should start the trial right away.  They might not be using premium features yet and this way 
  we can tell them which features they need to pay for before starting the trial.
  
    - we will need to record something, somewhere which says the length of the trial.
        - though if they have a referral code, they would get another 30 days.

- the initial 30 day trial should not require a CC, what about when the user is given an extension on the trial?

- can I convert trials to paying via stripe checkout?  (I'm finding out now via stripe)

## Remaining Challenges

- I have to test and make sure TRIALS work and that part is a pain too!

- NO trial subscription... just give them a premium account, which expires, and then they call back saying their
  subscription has expired, I downgrade them to free, then I try to get them to pay once their subscription has 
  expired.
  
    - so they sign up , and they ALREADY have premium... ? no 'triggering' a trial.. FAR less code involved.

# Coupons and Subscriptions

- create a subscription
- apply a coupon to it... ???
- how do I start a subscription for an existing customer ???


- I will need to test ALL the payment flows... 

- https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/subscriptions/updating
    - this is a huge fucking pain to setup!
