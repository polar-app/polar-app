            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>
                Polar started in late 2018 when Kevin was hyper-focused on
                building a distributed cryptocurrency platform which had a very
                mathematically complicated technology backend.

            <p>
                At one point he was managing hundreds of PDFs and textbooks and
                was overwhelmed and realized there had to be a better way.  The
                existing tools just did a horrible job manging this knowledge so
                he started building his own system for his personal use.
