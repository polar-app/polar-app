&lt;h1 id=&quot;students-avoid-these-flashcard-mistakes-for-long-term-retention&quot;&gt;Students: Avoid These Flashcard Mistakes for Long-Term Retention&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flashcards are a productive way to learn new information and actively test yourself. Studying with flashcards engages active recall. &lt;a href=&quot;http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/downloads/2008_Karpicke_Roediger_Science.pdf&quot;&gt;Active recall&lt;/a&gt; stimulates your brain by repeatedly asking it questions and retrieving answers. A study in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1529100612453266?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, concluded that engaging in active recall in the learning process has “high utility and can be implemented effectively with minimal training.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a study tool, flashcards are perfect for students at any educational level. In one study, about &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1060082.pdf&quot;&gt;70%&lt;/a&gt; of participants used flashcards to study for at least one exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get the most out of your flashcard studying, it’s important to create flashcards that help you remember and retain new information. Here are four mistakes that people often make when creating flashcards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-not-making-your-own-cards&quot;&gt;1. Not Making Your Own Cards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q0SZ9fh.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of creating your own flashcards is powerful, and it sets you up for success early on in the learning process. As you make your own flashcards, you are encouraged to think critically about creating effective flashcards. This process allows you to actively engage with the content and retrieve information more easily. Most importantly, making your own flashcards will strengthen your understanding and comprehension of the information. Your added effort in making flashcards from scratch will enhance your overall learning process and mastery of the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-studying-in-one-session&quot;&gt;2. Studying in One Session&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UuxeWEG.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying your flashcards in one session (aka cramming) will result in a lack of retention. To solve this problem, the learning technique of spaced repetition helps with the retention of new information at an efficient pace.  Spaced repetition is the process of reviewing information at increasing intervals of time with the use of flashcards. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dartmouth.edu/~cogedlab/pubs/Kang(2016,PIBBS).pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Dartmouth College found that spaced practice “enhances memory” and “produces superior long-term learning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New information must be repeated and reinforced frequently for long-term retention. Otherwise, you risk minimal improvement and dexterity in the learning process. Aristotle said it best when he observed: “it is frequent repetition that produces a natural tendency.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/docs/spaced-repetition.html&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://quizlet.com/&quot;&gt;Quizlet&lt;/a&gt; have spaced repetition software that support flashcard learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-not-using-a-software-to-study-your-flashcards&quot;&gt;3. Not Using a Software to Study Your Flashcards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making flashcards out of notecards may seem like an efficient way to study, but using software like &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; will greatly improve your learning process!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nOMZUef.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Polar, you can directly create &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/docs/annotation-sidebar.html&quot;&gt;annotations&lt;/a&gt; in your documents (pdf, textbook, web page). Additionally, you can create flashcards from your annotations with a click of a button. You don’t have to worry about losing your flashcards because all of your flashcards will be stored in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; is a software that aims to make remembering easy through the use of flashcards and spaced repetition. More specifically, Anki allows you to study and create your flashcards. In fact, Anki and Polar can both be used through their &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/docs/anki-sync-for-spaced-repetition.html&quot;&gt;integration&lt;/a&gt; for flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xNtMoQA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-overloading-your-flashcards-with-too-much-information&quot;&gt;4. Overloading Your Flashcards With Too Much Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting too much information on a flashcard causes unnecessary information overload. It can hinder your learning process in a major way by feeding your brain superfluous information. Instead, you should break up big concepts into multiple questions and flashcards. Limit content on each flashcard to &lt;strong&gt;one question&lt;/strong&gt;. This will streamline your learning process and help you engage more effectively in the active recall process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-guide-to-incremental-reading-for-students-and-continuous-learners&quot;&gt;A Guide to Incremental Reading for Students and Continuous Learners&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-incremental-reading&quot;&gt;What is Incremental Reading?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in structuring your reading in an efficient way? Then, incremental reading is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few words, incremental reading is &lt;strong&gt;the technique of reading articles in small portions&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s essentially the method of breaking articles into logical steps to make it easier to digest knowledge. Incremental reading is perfect for people who do a lot of reading—undergrads, grad students, researchers, professors, and almost any knowledge worker in front of a screen these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the &lt;strong&gt;basic components of incremental reading&lt;/strong&gt;, here are the inputs and outputs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inputs: articles, PDFs, and textbooks 
Outputs: Text that is broken into subsegments and retained knowledge in the form of flashcards in question/answer format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;rough outline of the incremental reading process&lt;/strong&gt; is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capture an article in your personal reading repository
Break up the article into manageable portions and then read the portions one by one
Two examples are to break up the article into paragraphs or topic
Extract key information 
Key information is anything you would underline, highlight, or want to remember
 Convert information into flashcards, either as question-answer pairs or cloze deletions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique of incremental reading is &lt;strong&gt;different from reading directly from your browser&lt;/strong&gt;. With incremental reading, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read hundreds of articles in parallel 
Prioritize, sort, and schedule articles
Directly annotate and highlight key pieces of information in the article
Extract key information into flashcards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-jigsaw-puzzle-of-incremental-reading&quot;&gt;The Jigsaw Puzzle of Incremental Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analogy of incremental reading given by SuperMemo is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Jigsaw_puzzle_metaphor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jigsaw puzzle metaphor&lt;/a&gt;. It states that “for a good model of the world, we need to assemble little pieces of knowledge into a coherent structure.” A foreign concept is incomprehensible in the beginning because the puzzle pieces and bits of information are unconnected to each other. “Chunking” pieces of knowledge (like puzzle pieces) together over time will help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the concept. This is why reading and processing information incrementally is beneficial for learning concepts thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advantages-of-incremental-reading&quot;&gt;Advantages of Incremental Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With incremental reading, you can &lt;strong&gt;read multiple documents at the same time&lt;/strong&gt; without overwhelming yourself. As you organize and dissect your readings into digestible portions, you will be able to read at an overall faster pace. In the beginning, you will quickly skim through an article to split it up. Then, you will return to the article to read the portions more closely one by one. Overall, this strategy helps you read at an efficient and fast pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of incremental reading is that you can &lt;strong&gt;suspend and resume&lt;/strong&gt; your reading without any restrictions on time. With the pagemark feature in Polar, you can mark the regions of a document that you’ve completed reading and return to the document at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why you &lt;a href=&quot;http://super-memory.com/english/princip.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forget&lt;/a&gt; a new concept is because you don’t frequently review it. Incremental reading solves this problem by the continual review of knowledge. A software like Polar will determine the time between reviewing portions of the same article. As a result, incremental reading leads to long term memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By practicing incremental reading, you will gain the skill of &lt;strong&gt;text prioritization&lt;/strong&gt;. After splitting an article into manageable portions, you will identify important pieces of information. By strategically selecting pieces of an article for further review, you avoid wasting time. You don’t have to read an entire article again because you’ve already picked out the most important parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incremental reading can &lt;strong&gt;boost your attention span&lt;/strong&gt;. With incremental reading, you can split large portions of materials into digestible chunks without overwhelming yourself. You can increase your overall attention by focusing on small portions of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incremental reading encourages &lt;strong&gt;creativity&lt;/strong&gt;. By studying different subjects and topics in parallel, you develop the power to associate ideas together. Software like Polar enables readers to create non-linear connections and manage a networked organization of annotations/highlights. You will develop intellectual and mental dexterity by continuous exposure to different subject matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;incremental-reading-in-supermemo&quot;&gt;Incremental Reading in SuperMemo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supermemo.com/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SuperMemo&lt;/a&gt; was the first incremental reading software on the market. The father of SuperMemo is Piotr Wozniak. Wozniak was inspired to create SuperMemo when he struggled to retain course material as a computer science student at the Poznan University of Technology. He believed that frequent repetition and systemic management of newly acquired material was key for retention, so he developed a spaced repetition software called SuperMemo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the basic breakdown of incremental reading in SuperMemo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Import an article into SuperMemo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0eM7wow.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Split up the article into manageable sections (paragraphs or by topic)
If the article is separated into paragraphs, then you would read paragraph 1 and extract key pieces of information (phrases, sentences, keywords, definitions). Then, make cloze deletions or questions/answers out of the key information. 
A day later, SuperMemo will show you the question/answers you created for paragraph 1. You will do repetitions for these cloze deletions or questions/answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/d3wE7iK.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next couple of days, you will process paragraph 2 and follow the same procedure as you did with paragraph 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;incremental-reading-in-polar&quot;&gt;Incremental Reading in Polar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt; is a modern tool for incremental reading. Polar not only enables you to organize huge amounts of readings from different sources (e.g., PDfs, epubs, webpages) but also supports spaced repetition for flashcards and annotations on mobile and desktop devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar features that support incremental reading:
Document Repository: You can organize multiple reading materials (pdfs, webpages, ebooks) in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4rClAxt.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/docs/pagemarks.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pagemarks&lt;/a&gt; in Polar allow you to mark regions of a document and specify multiple ranges of text. You can also turn on the auto-pagemark feature to track progress automatically. On the main page of Polar and the top of your document, the progress reading bar will show you exactly where you left the pagemark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7O1QseQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annotations: In Polar, it’s very easy to create annotations. Simply highlight key information and it will automatically appear in the annotation sidebar. You can also create tags for your annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/beb8Qhh.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a guide on how to do incremental reading in Polar:
Use the Polar chrome extension if reading webpages
Highlight key information from the text and the annotation sidebar will automatically save information within the document 
Auto-convert information in the annotation sidebar into flashcards by clicking the lightning symbol
Review flashcards in Polar directly or by syncing your flashcards into &lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/734898866&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; 
When you want to start studying your annotations and flashcards in Polar, click the “Annotations” tab. Then click “Start Review.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SDBrleo.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the basic life cycle of your flashcards with Polar’s own spaced repetition software:
In the beginning, flashcards will be put in &lt;strong&gt;learning&lt;/strong&gt; mode until you’ve been able to get a good grasp of the material.
Next, they will be put in &lt;strong&gt;review&lt;/strong&gt; mode. This mode schedules the learning at decreasing intervals of time as you accurately complete the flashcards. 
The flashcards you’ve mastered (selected “&lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;”) will be reviewed every year or so. If you review a flashcard and don’t know the answer, click “&lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt;.” This card will be sent back to the learning mode, then the review mode if you remember it a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/docs/incremental-reading.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;incremental reading&lt;/a&gt; helps you effectively structure your reading in a way that helps you retain information in the long-term. With a software like Polar, you can easily organize and manage multiple readings in a document repository. In addition, Polar’s spaced repetition software will schedule your annotations and flashcards for review. All in all, Polar will satisfy your incremental reading needs and help you learn better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Former Miss Ohio And Hollywood Actress Reads Daily To Advocate For Health</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2020/06/20/Former-Miss-Ohio-And-Hollywood-Actress-Reads-Daily-to-Advocate-for-Health.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Former Miss Ohio And Hollywood Actress Reads Daily To Advocate For Health" /><published>2020-06-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-06-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2020/06/20/Former-Miss-Ohio-And-Hollywood-Actress-Reads-Daily-to-Advocate-for-Health</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2020/06/20/Former-Miss-Ohio-And-Hollywood-Actress-Reads-Daily-to-Advocate-for-Health.html">&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-former-miss-ohio-and-hollywood-actress-advocates-for-heart-health&quot;&gt;A Former Miss Ohio and Hollywood Actress Advocates for Heart Health&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Davis is actively working to save the lives of children with heart conditions. She is a former Miss Ohio, unafraid to speak up and demand change from our lawmakers on Capitol Hill. An important part of Lindsay’s advocacy efforts is reading as she educates herself on the latest legislation and research on heart health. Read more to learn about Lindsay’s inspiring story and advocacy work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-the-advocacy-took-root&quot;&gt;Where the Advocacy Took Root&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay’s hometown of Lakewood, Ohio, was the beginning of her journey to advocacy. The small civic-minded city cultivated a passion within Lindsay to lead by example and serve others with compassion. Her teachers taught her how to actively take part in the community by planting trees or writing to lawmakers. A community “filled with hope for a better future,” inspired and motivated Lindsay to create meaningful change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay had dreams of attending Julliard and joining the Paris Opera Ballet, so she trained seven days a week. Her dreams came to an end when she collapsed after dance practice at the age of seventeen. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital and diagnosed with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;life-as-miss-ohio-and-a-hollywood-actress&quot;&gt;Life as Miss Ohio and a Hollywood Actress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lyQUyqc.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of allowing the HCM diagnosis to take control of her life, Lindsay turned her pain into a passion for heart health advocacy and awareness. Before committing to advocacy full-time, Lindsay was Miss Ohio and an actress in Hollywood. Lindsay says her title as Miss Ohio prepared her for a career in advocacy. The life of a pageant queen and an advocate are never-ending judged performances that require constant traveling, interviews, and discussions with diverse audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an actress, Lindsay enjoyed the notion of the entertainment industry because she was able to bring joy to the people watching. But, advocacy proved to be more fulfilling than acting. Lindsay knew that she could use her platform to help children in their fight against heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-advocacy&quot;&gt;Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Advocacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rspjX2R.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a heart health advocate, Lindsay focuses on prevention because sudden cardiac arrest is typically the first symptom of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. Oftentimes HCM isn’t diagnosed before a sudden cardiac arrest, so Lindsay’s objectives are focused on raising awareness on the signs and symptoms attributed to heart disease. Her hope is that heart conditions are diagnosed before they manifest a sudden cardiac arrest and lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a teen diagnosed with HCM, Lindsay has been able to live a fulfilling life with modifications to her activities and dreams. She wants other children to have the same chance at a long life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest takes the lives of 14,000 children and young adults annually in the U.S. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrsonline.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Heart Rhythm Society&lt;/a&gt;), and more than 1 in 100 babies are born with congenital heart conditions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/heartdefects/data.html#References&quot;&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;). According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonscientific.eu/en-US/heart-disease-facts/young-athletes.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boston Scientific&lt;/a&gt;, sudden cardiac arrest is the number one killer of student-athletes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lindsays-law&quot;&gt;Lindsay’s Law&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XIDEoYc.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working with the Ohio legislature, Lindsay helped pass an awareness bill called Lindsay’s Law (named after her). The &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22773708/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Journal of the American Board of Family&lt;/a&gt; states that seventy-two percent of children who pass away from sudden cardiac arrest report symptoms that no one attributes to heart disease. As a result, the bill educates coaches, parents, and students on the signs and symptoms of an underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a student is exhibiting symptoms they’re removed from play until they are cleared by a doctor. The main goal of Lindsay’s Law is to protect students and educate the people responsible for their safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many parents reach out to Lindsay and tell her how Lindsay’s Law saved their child’s life. These stories give Lindsay hope that there are concrete ways to mitigate risk for patients and ensure that they have a long life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;capitol-hill&quot;&gt;Capitol Hill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/f6JKrCP.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay is actively advocating for patient and cardiac legislations and increases in research funding on Capitol Hill. Two pieces of legislation that Lindsay supports—the SAFE PLAY Act and HEARTS Act—were recently introduced in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UsoYKaw.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1209&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HEARTS Act&lt;/a&gt; is bipartisan legislation that is essentially Lindsay’s Law on a national level with added surveillance of heart conditions. Another Lindsay’s Law type legislation is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/829&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SAFE PLAY Act&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on advancing safety guidelines for young athletes. It also includes grants for CPR training and automated external defibrillators for schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay works closely with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heart.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acc.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American College of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; to advocate for legislative initiatives centered on heart health and cardiac patient care. In partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heart.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, Lindsay met with members of Congress to discuss banning flavored tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay’s goal as an advocate is to help in any way that she can, no matter how small it may be. Lindsay also advocates for homeless people in New York City. She notices that homeless people are forgotten in the busy city, so she shares their stories on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/handmehope/?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; as a way to amplify their voices. She passionately says that homeless people aren’t any less, they’re equals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coming-soon-to-bookstores&quot;&gt;Coming Soon to Bookstores…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, Lindsay wants to better protect children with heart conditions through policy reform and a children’s book. She’s working with the main editor of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hypertrophic-Cardiomyopathy-Srihari-S-Naidu/dp/3319924222/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=hypertrophic+cardiomyopathy&amp;amp;qid=1591303374&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy textbook&lt;/a&gt; and a pediatric psychologist to help create the content of her book. The children’s book will cover topics of the heart and how it functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay hopes that writing a book with relatable characters will give young patients comfort during painful times. She wants children to know that they aren’t alone in their fight with heart disease. Most importantly, Lindsay’s book will help spread awareness about young patients battling heart disease. Books like Lindsay’s have the power to educate the public and transform lives for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-power-of-storytelling&quot;&gt;The Power of Storytelling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes young people feel powerless or helpless in the current society and political climate. Lindsay says that young advocates should use their stories and experiences to catalyze change in the issues they’re passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay says that in advocacy work, storytelling is key. Numbers and statistics rarely leave a lasting impression on lawmakers and people. It’s about the “connection you give them to a cause.” Young people should never doubt their ability to create positive change in the world. If you don’t step up, then who will?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-real-advocate-for-a-better-world&quot;&gt;A Real Advocate for a Better World&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dknykda.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Davis is a powerful example of someone who hasn’t let their circumstances define them. She has taken control of her life and utilized her platform to advocate for children with heart conditions. Her words will live on and continue to positively impact the lives of children for generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt;, our vision is to make education a basic human right, and we share Lindsay’s enthusiasm for spreading awareness and knowledge. We strongly believe that written words have the power to open minds and create lasting change.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">title: “A Former Miss Ohio and Hollywood Actress Reads Daily to Advocate for Health” date: 2020-07-30T08:00:00.000-08:00 layout: post large_image: https://i.imgur.com/JDaRIhF.png description: A Former Miss Ohio and Hollywood Actress Reads Daily to Advocate for Health —</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How I Successfully Coped With the Pandemic: A Student’s Perspective</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2020/06/02/How-I-Successfully-Coped-With-the-Pandemic-A-Student's-Perspective.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How I Successfully Coped With the Pandemic: A Student's Perspective" /><published>2020-06-02T10:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-06-02T10:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2020/06/02/How-I-Successfully-Coped-With-the-Pandemic-A-Student's-Perspective</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2020/06/02/How-I-Successfully-Coped-With-the-Pandemic-A-Student's-Perspective.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Exc48ep.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-i-successfully-coped-with-the-pandemic-a-students-perspective&quot;&gt;How I Successfully Coped With the Pandemic: A Student’s Perspective&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Sweta and I’m a sophomore at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business (aka Zoom University) studying Economic Consulting, Public Policy Analysis, and Sustainable Business. Isn’t that a mouthful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the abrupt ending of my freshman year, I was anxious about the prospect of online learning. The transition to studying at home while still fulfilling my responsibilities as a college student scared me even more.  After a relatively tough adjustment period (and a few meltdowns), I was able to maintain a steady rhythm and adjust my daily habits to the new reality. Here are 5 tips I used to end my semester strong academically and keep my emotional and physical health intact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D43zeEK.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;save-your-sanity-by-effectively-silencing-your-phone&quot;&gt;Save Your Sanity by Effectively Silencing Your Phone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first few weeks of quarantine, I was glued to my phone. I looked to the news app for any kind of solace that the pandemic (and toilet paper shortage) was ending. Unfortunately, I was bombarded with depressing reports and heart-wrenching stories about overcrowded hospitals. This wrecked my emotional wellbeing and also put a damper on my productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1itYyg2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to excel in my courses, I needed to limit my distractions and implement these following tools into my life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switch your phone to &lt;strong&gt;Do Not Disturb&lt;/strong&gt; (feature on the iPhone). Instead of having the temptation to check my phone every single time it rings, I only check it when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you spend way too much time on some apps like Instagram or TikTok? The &lt;strong&gt;Screen Time&lt;/strong&gt; feature on your iPhone may help you solve this time-consuming problem. You can set a time limit for any app on your phone with this cool feature. Apps like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom.to/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Freedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forestapp.cc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can also help you cut the time you spend on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a little too obsessed with your email like I am, limit your email checking to only &lt;strong&gt;3 times a day&lt;/strong&gt;. Once in the morning, during lunchtime, and before you go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major source of obsession during this time is the news. Save your sanity by turning off the never-ending news notifications. Here are some great alternatives to staying up to date on the coronavirus (while not losing your mind):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only check the news in the morning
Subscribe to daily email newsletters like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theskimm.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theSkimm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theweek.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TheWeek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
For good news and inspiring stories follow Good Good Good (&lt;strong&gt;@goodgoodgoodco&lt;/strong&gt;) on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;treat-yo-self-with-self-care-and-chocolate&quot;&gt;Treat Yo’ Self With Self-Care (and Chocolate!)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parks and Recreation’s Tom Haverford once wisely said, “Treat yo’ self!” We should all follow Tom’s advice and treat ourselves with lots of self-care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dwFDQjE.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chocolate is a must for me, especially during this global pandemic. I treat myself to a delicious dark chocolate truffle twice a day. No matter what your form of self-care is, it’s important to take time out of your day to focus on your own well being. If you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed during this difficult time, focus on the things you can control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom call/FaceTime your friends and have a &lt;strong&gt;movie night&lt;/strong&gt;! You can also use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflixparty.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Netflix Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to watch and chat with your friends or family in real-time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these times, it can feel like we don’t have control over much. A conscious way that I remind myself that I do have control and purpose is through a &lt;strong&gt;gratitude journal&lt;/strong&gt;. Every night before bed, I write what I’m grateful for. It doesn’t have to be a twelve-point single-spaced five-page essay (my worst nightmare), but a few sentences of what gives you hope and joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably saw this one coming—exercise. If you don’t have access to exercise equipment at home, try these &lt;strong&gt;at-home workouts&lt;/strong&gt; that work just as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoga&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Pilates&lt;/strong&gt; (YouTube is your best friend here)
Go outside for a &lt;strong&gt;15-minute walk&lt;/strong&gt; (I hear you… this isn’t really at home)
&lt;strong&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson 7 Minute Workout App&lt;/strong&gt; (Hell Week for Navy Seals. Uh, I mean… high-intensity interval training)
&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/7YWRr4q&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;People with home gyms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improve-your-focus-with-functional-music&quot;&gt;Improve Your Focus With Functional Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course work is always a challenge (let’s admit it…), but now it became my nemesis. Even if I sat in silence, my mind wandered and I struggled to finish even the smallest tasks. It was hard to ignore the noises and chatter in my house as I’m quarantined with my family (we all know how annoying that can get).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An app that helped me get more work done and relax my anxiety around the coronavirus, was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brain.fm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brain.fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s an app that plays 30-minute clips of functional music that is backed by extensive research and science. Whether you need to study, relax, or sleep, brain.fm can help you reach your goals and get that A+!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve your focus, I recommend listening to music without speech or lyrics. Additionally, listening to songs with sounds of nature is scientifically proven by researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to boost your mood and focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3B3XWoo.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stay-motivated-with-the-pomodoro-technique&quot;&gt;Stay Motivated With the Pomodoro Technique&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8uQZiCQ.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My motivation to study or get out of bed was at an all-time low in the first few weeks of quarantine. I found that being a college student at home wasn’t conducive to a strong motivation or longing to learn. I found most of my motivation from my peers on campus, so I needed to figure out a way to fuel my motivation remotely. Here’s a virtual technique I used with my study buddies to keep me motivated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a video platform, you can virtually study with your friends with the help of the Pomodoro Technique. Here are the guidelines for an efficient &lt;strong&gt;Pomodoro study session&lt;/strong&gt; with your friends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study for 25 minutes
Take a 5-minute break where you can chat with friends
Repeat the process and at the hour mark take a 15-minute break&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this free online tool to keep the time of your Pomodoro study session: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marinaratimer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pomodoro Method Style Time Management Tool &amp;amp; Timer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, remind yourself of your long term goals. Keep the big picture in mind and know that better days are ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;study-smarter-not-harder&quot;&gt;Study Smarter! Not Harder!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SnBt1J4.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the challenges of online learning and awkward zoom classes, it’s important to have every tool in your arsenal to ace your classes. Let’s be real—when you’re balancing 17 credit hours, family arguments, and anxiety over the world ending—studying your entire accounting textbook is like climbing Mount Everest. Here’s how I made my climb a little more bearable while enjoying the view (even if my view was watching the Amazon delivery man drop off the million packages I ordered): 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/FKYTrDd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Puppy looking out the window&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to ditch cramming and embrace the technique of spaced repetition. Spaced repetition is a technique where you spread out your learning over time. This technique helps you learn more effectively and retain information long-term. Here are some tools that seamlessly integrate spaced repetition into flashcard learning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With **&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;
**, your digital flashcards are personally tracked and analyzed for long-term retention as you study the flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, you can auto-convert your text into digital flashcards and learn using spaced repetition. Polar will also manage all your documents (web pages, textbooks, and PDFs) in one place. 
If you want to gain a deeper understanding of the material you are being taught and retain the information, &lt;strong&gt;handwritten notes&lt;/strong&gt; are the way to go! You always have the option of transferring your handwritten notes to digital text with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pen-to-print.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pen to Print&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein once said, “If you can’t explain it to a six-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself.” No wonder he’s brilliant! To make sure you have a clear understanding of the material, assume the role of a teacher. Explain the material to someone who is new to the subject, and see how well you communicate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re feeling bored during this quarantine or have run out of shows to watch, I recommend enrolling in free courses from top universities through &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. 
We all know that finding the motivation to study in the midst of a global pandemic is a real struggle. That’s why I curated these tips and tools to help you navigate this new reality and excel in your courses. I’ll leave you with the words of Bob Marley, &lt;strong&gt;“Don’t worry ‘bout a thing, cause every little thing’s gonna be alright.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-anonymous-story-of-a-nyc-resident-at-the-frontlines-of-the-covid-19-pandemic&quot;&gt;The Anonymous Story Of A NYC Resident At The Frontlines Of The COVID-19 Pandemic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted all of our lives. NYC residents have been particularly hard stricken. As of April 10, the total number of confirmed cases is over 100,000, with almost seven thousand fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a rare chance to talk about the current situation to a anesthesiology resident in NYC. Sarah (name changed) is in her late twenties and a third year resident in a large hospital in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-daily-struggle-is-pushing-everyone-to-the-limit&quot;&gt;The daily struggle is pushing everyone to the limit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She spoke with us after  yet another 14 hour shift and is making food before crashing in her small one-bed room apartment in the Upper East Side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As an anesthesiologist, you usually have two roles” Sarah starts, “you are an intensive care doctor, tending to the day to day work for your critical patients, as well as taking urgent calls for intubations”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, a resident would do five intubations a day, maximum.. “That’s already a busy day. Now we’re doing an average of 20!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like everybody in the hospital, intubation teams are being pushed to their limits these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the high patient numbers, hospitals have run out of space. “Normally, intubations are supposed to be done in a negative pressure rooms to minimize risks of infections. However, because it’s so busy, we’re doing it in a standard room with just a curtain around the patient’s bed. Next the patient is already the next one. No privacy, no containment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;patients-are-sometimes-surprised-to-learn-they-are-infected&quot;&gt;Patients are sometimes surprised to learn they are infected&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worsening matters, patients oftentimes don’t know they have the virus when the intubation team arrives. This means the team informs them as they start the intubation. Doctors who usually inform the patient beforehand are too busy attending to other patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When patients realize what’s going on, they try to frantically call family to tell them about the situation,” says Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher mortality because hospitals are past their limits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Approximately 20% of cases get hospitalized, and 20% of those need intubation,” points out Sarah. “50% of those who get intubated die”. Of course, numbers vary significantly across age group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the mortality rate is so high because we are past our limits and not capable to provide the level of care we normally would”, says Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously patients in the ICU need a lot of care which is why one nurse typically only takes care of no more than two ICU patients. 
“They need to be turned every two hours to avoid pressure sores, labs need to be taken every six hours, and a host of vital signs are constantly monitored to step in immediately if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, one nurse will take care of four patients on average. And we are still short on nurses. This means nurses with no or limited experience with critical care are being coached in the moment”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nobody is getting turned every two hours. Nobody is doing PT. And keep in mind, the average intubation period is three weeks for those patients”, elaborates Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the worst cases, patients might wake up after intubation due to limited attention from nurses. Those patients oftentimes get agitated and self-extubate, which only worsens their situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday, the Emergency Department had 16 patients on ventilators. “There was simply no space in the ICU. The ratio of patient to nurse was 13:1”, Sarah continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a good hospital with a large critical care team. Despite that, we still might have to give a crash course to an orthopedic surgeon who never managed a ventilator before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;medical-staff-are-holding-up-but-long-term-effects-are-unclear&quot;&gt;Medical staff are holding up but long-term effects are unclear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked Sarah how she and hospital staff are impacted by the situation.
“I’m used to seeing patients with terminal illnesses. The hard part is knowing it’s impossible to provide them with the best care.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“However, we are not used to seeing young patients with no medical history in those situations.” Normally, patients who get intubated already have multiple illnesses. “But in the current situation, you see patients who are 41, no medical history, non-smokers, fighting for their lives”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what hits especially young doctors the hardest. Sarah argues that the immediate impact on her mental health is very manageable. “My hospital is providing me with excellent support.” Mental health and wellness initiatives are available for doctors and hospital staff at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“However, it’s impossible to predict what the long-term impact will be on all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;supply-chain-of-equipment-is-still-intact&quot;&gt;Supply chain of equipment is still intact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very comforting observation is a never-ending supply of donations to hospitals. The hospital has enough personal protective equipment (PPE) and donations keep coming in. “I know not every hospital accepts direct donations. “Donations that can’t be accepted, we can keep for personal use”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of PPE donations, the hospital has been receiving donations of food and other daily necessities. “We had really, really good steak, salads, and pizza donated last week. Some even drop off wine to support us when we’re out of the hospital”, she says with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, hospitals are making sure that staff stay as safe as possible. “The reason for the cold trucks outside of hospitals is not that there’s no space in our morgues. But the morgues don’t accept patients infected with COVID-19 to avoid spread of the disease.”, she elaborates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bodies are then taken to be cremated. This, however, sometimes results in pushback from the families. “But cremation is essential to prevent the spread”, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;number-of-new-cases-are-easing-up-in-nyc&quot;&gt;Number of new cases are easing up in NYC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the hope is that “this and last week are the peak in NYC. We are already seeing admissions slowing down.” However, it remains critically important to do everything possible to flatten the curve and slow down the spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One worry is a resurgence of cases once the lockdown is lifted. ”Realistically, we won’t get in the safe zone until we get a vaccine out – hopefully by September or October”, Sarah explains. “Some people are saying it might be seasonal. That would mean that even if we get a vaccine out, we might get it back in a few months”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;message-to-the-people&quot;&gt;Message to the people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, we ask Sarah if she has a message for us at home. Her response speaks volumes the spirit of New Yorkers (which we can 100% attest to after having lived there for a long time ourselves).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m really thankful for the generosity the people have shown. We get donations en masse. Every day we get personal equipment, food, and other supplies”, Sarah responds. “Restaurants are delivering food for free. Those restaurants point out that they themselves received donations and instructions to prepare food for the hospitals around them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-an-astronauts-experience-can-enable-us-to-study-better-from-home&quot;&gt;How An Astronaut’s Experience Can Enable Us To Study Better From Home&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us are going into week 2 of studying and working remotely. Obviously, we humans are not made to stay in a confined space for a long time. That’s why it’s even more important to be deliberate about how we go about our daily lives. Here at &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt;, we’re working on a tool to enable remote studying and knowledge management. We did want to take some time, however, to look at what else we can do to optimize our time at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the subsequent post, we summarize key learnings from an astronaut’s experience in space. Back in 2015 / 2016, Scott Kelly spent nearly a year in space living on the ISS. In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/opinion/scott-kelly-coronavirus-isolation.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the New York Times, he admits it “wasn’t always easy but I learned some things during my time up there”. His experience clearly shows that there is a way to make this productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-secondary&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DRYuC2t.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;follow-a-routine&quot;&gt;Follow a routine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maintaining a plan will help you adjust to a different environment”, says Kelly. “On the space station, my time was scheduled tightly, from the moment I woke up to when I went to sleep”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that classes are remote, it’s easier to let a regular schedule slip. We see it ourselves. For example, the gym is closed and of course it’s harder to work out at home. However, keeping a set schedule will prevent us from slipping into a world where we end up only sitting on the couch, smoking weed, and eating unhealthy food. Hell, while you’re at it, this might be a good time to incorporate some good habits into your daily routine, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMjhwFE1Zw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wim Hof method&lt;/a&gt;. And if you need some motivation, we have just the right &lt;a href=&quot;https://davidgoggins.com/book/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; for you to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pace-yourself&quot;&gt;Pace yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you are living and working in the same place for days on end, work can have a way of taking over everything if you let it”, Kelly argues. “Living in space, I deliberately paced myself because I knew I was in it for the long haul.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways to achieve that - reading a book, calling friends, or simply taking a nap. We see it ourselves all the time. There is always one more thing that needs to be done, always one additional discussion to be had. However, a refreshed mind is much more useful than an overworked and stressed one. So make sure you pace yourself.
On the flip side, make sure you don’t “pace yourself” too much. &lt;a href=&quot;https://shyamsankar.com/the-case-against-work-life-balance-owning-your-future&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;It’s interesting&lt;/a&gt; how people typically only state “it’s a marathon, not a sprint” to argue for more comfort, not of sustained excellence. If you want to achieve all your dreams, you simply have to put in the time. Of course while pacing yourself ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spent-time-outside-while-keeping-social-distance&quot;&gt;Spent time outside (while keeping social distance)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main advantages of living in the Bay Area is nature. Obviously, with every passing day, it’s becoming harder for me to spend time outside. But while it’s still possible, make sure you go out for walks and get some fresh air. Of course while maintaining the necessary social distance. In fact, while you’re at it, you might want to consider wearing a mask, even if just makeshift. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoDwXwZXsDI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;early indication&lt;/a&gt; that masks are a key part in fighting the spreading of the virus. So, do go outside. And be reasonable about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-on-hobbies&quot;&gt;Focus on hobbies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duh. This is obvious but we tend to forget it in times of stress (like finals… or a pandemic). Usually, reading is a good hobby to pick up. Now you might argue you’re already reading a lot for school (and simplifying your reading and information management with &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt; ;) ). That’s ok. Pick something else. I recently picked up cooking again. Whatever it is, make sure it gives you the timeout you need from your studies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-journaling&quot;&gt;Start journaling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASA discovered that keeping a journal is one of the most effective activities to keep us sane. Interesting, huh? “Even if you don’t wind up writing a book based on your journal like I did, writing about your days will help put your experiences in perspective and let you look back later on what this unique time in history has meant”, Kelly shares. There are many different versions of journaling out there. I’ve been doing my own version for over 10 years and absolutely love it. While you’re at it, definitely add affirmations to it. Then go out and kick butt achieving those goals you tell yourself during the affirmations. Well, stay inside and achieve those goals ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-time-to-connect&quot;&gt;Take time to connect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Isolation is damaging not only to our mental health, but to our physical health as well, especially our immune system”, Kelly warns. Make sure you regularly connect with loved ones and close friends. Now might even be a good time to reconnect with this one person you’ve lost contact with a while back… or reconnect with your ex you still think of. Melissa, how are you doing…? ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;listen-to-expert-voices&quot;&gt;Listen to expert voices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally… listen to experts. “Living in space taught me a lot about the importance of trusting the advice of people who knew more than I did about their subjects”, Kelly shares. Given how much misinformation is actively being spread these days about the coronavirus (did you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51735367&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hear&lt;/a&gt; how garlic can prevent the spread of coronavirus?), make sure you listen to people with authority in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Polar 1.100.13 - Tags for Annotations</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2020/03/27/Polar-1-100-13-Tags-For-Annotations.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polar 1.100.13 - Tags for Annotations" /><published>2020-03-27T10:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-03-27T10:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2020/03/27/Polar-1-100-13-Tags-For-Annotations</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2020/03/27/Polar-1-100-13-Tags-For-Annotations.html">&lt;p&gt;Polar 1.100.12 is now available on the web for all desktop users and will be rolling out over the next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tags-for-annotations&quot;&gt;Tags for Annotations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main feature of this release is tags for annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been frequently requested by users and we finally were able to devote 
the time to making sure it was implemented properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stability&quot;&gt;Stability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we’ve also fixed a number of bugs in this release including a bad one
that sometimes prevented the UI from updating when working with annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working on moving the entire platform over to React including the PDF 
viewer.  Once this is complete we’ll be able to quickly finish implementing 
EPUB, dark mode, and some improvements to our chrome extension to enable 
annotation and capture directly in the browser for web content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will also meant that tablet and phone support can come online as 2.0 is 
being designed with mobile support in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;full-changelog&quot;&gt;Full Changelog&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;annotations in the annotation view are now sorted by ‘last updated’ not the
creation time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;annotations can have tags&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;17-tips-for-crushing-it-with-anki-while-studying-remotely&quot;&gt;17 tips for crushing it with Anki while studying remotely&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, Anki has become a staple for us when learning with flashcards. Usually, we annotate our readings in &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt;, then auto-convert those annotations into flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest reason I love using Anki is that it simplifies learning by reminding me when to repeat flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar supports both textbooks and webpages, which made it a key part of our workflow for both schoolwork and personal learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, we are summarizing our key learnings for Anki. For most part, these tips also work for other spaced repetition platforms, like Quizlet or Supermemo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-understand-how-spaced-repetition-works&quot;&gt;1. Understand how spaced repetition works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tool is only as useful as we make it for us, so make sure you understand how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spaced reptition&lt;/a&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is to why repeated review is crucial. That will avoid reverting back to the standard approach - wait until a week before the exam and freak out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-secondary&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/otv7GF0.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-speed-up-flashcard-creation&quot;&gt;2. Speed up flashcard creation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating flashcards takes time which it shouldn’t have to. That’s why we use Polar to speed things up. Polar allows you to auto-convert annotations into flashcards. They can easily be synced with Anki for studying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Polar supports incremental reading and reading progress tracking. That’s crucial to manage multiple readings and continue where you left off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-secondary&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rbAwfR6.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-maximize-impact-of-active-recall&quot;&gt;3. Maximize impact of active recall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also understand why &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;active recall&lt;/a&gt; is so important.
Active recall is a principle of efficient learning. It claims the need to actively stimulate memory during the learning process. It contrasts with passive review, in which the learning material is processed passively (e.g. by reading, watching, etc.). For example, reading a text about George Washington, with no further action, is a passive review. Answering the question “Who was the first US President?”, is active recall.
Essentially you want everything to be a question and you want to have to think of the answer. It’s this thinking process which allows your brain to map weights to specific neurons and actually retain information.
Don’t give leading questions or hints to the answer. If you don’t know the questions that’s fine. Just mark that on the card so it’s brought up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-build-a-habit&quot;&gt;4. Build a habit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You couldn’t sit down at the end of the month and brush your teeth for 2-3 hours to make up for not brushing would you?
The same is true for using spaced repetition - it should be a daily process of 15 - 60 min. Do it while you’re commuting. Or bored. Or even worse - waiting in line at the DMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-secondary&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fwgmZOX.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-aim-for-90-difficulty-add-link-to-the-rule-here&quot;&gt;5. Aim for 90% difficulty (add link to the rule here)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should try to target 85-90% difficulty for your cards. If you go into Anki stats you can see the difficulty level for your recent usage.
Too easy and you’re probably reviewing too often (and wasting time). Too hard and you’re not learning anything because you don’t have the understanding.
So, you want it to be difficult but not too difficult.
Unfortunately Anki doesn’t tune itself so you have to tune Anki directly.
You can adjust this in the per-deck settings by changing the ease factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-think-long-term&quot;&gt;6. Think long-term&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t give up on cards after you’ve finished a class or other milestone.
The cool thing about spaced repetition is that you can remember the material forever. If you paid money to learn Calculus you might as well keep it. Once you’ve learned it using spaced repetition is mostly about maintenance.
Since you know the material the scheduling will get farther and farther in the future and there won’t be such a massive burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-use-the-right-card-type&quot;&gt;7. Use the right card type&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should prefer to use question and answer cards.
These are in the form of
Q: What is the capital of California?
A: Sacramento
This would be as opposed to cloze deletion cards like:
[Sacramento] is the capital of California.
In the above the ‘Sacramento’ string is hidden.
Cloze deletion cards might seem easy but they often give away context clues which weakens the entire point of spaced repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-secondary&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MaTlTKG.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-use-cloze-deletions-for-languages&quot;&gt;8. Use cloze deletions for languages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one main exception for cloze deletion cards - languages (especially in med school)
Cloze can be good to help with grammar and sentence structure. They should NOT replace Q/A cards though.
For a given word you should have the definition and the forward and reverse translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-secondary&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/G66EqlD.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-use-image-occlusion&quot;&gt;9. Use image occlusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another powerful use case of flashcards is image occlusion, especially in med school. 
Image occlusion allows you practice identifying parts of an image by hiding its description.
After all, it would be quite useful to actually be able to identify the spleen during surgery instead of just knowing facts about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-secondary&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JAo54HZ.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-create-related-cards-for-a-360-understanding&quot;&gt;10. Create related cards for a 360 understanding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling to remember cards because it seems like random facts, add more cards around the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want to know who was the first vice president of the US ( John Adams), add a card about who was the second president (surprise surprise - John Adams again). Now it’s much easier to get a better understanding of Adam’s career, not just the random fact that he was the first Vice President.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;11-make-it-absurd-and-fun&quot;&gt;11. Make it absurd and fun&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were driving to work and you saw a naked man riding a horse on the side of the road would you need to remember it?
Would you have to write it down?
No. It would burn in your mind. You’d remember this image for a decade. Do this for your Anki cards you’re trying to remember.
Below is an example of a ‘fun’ mnemonic device. I’m sure you have all seen more absurd and ridiculous ones, which we’ll abstain from showing here for now…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border border-secondary&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YtpRZX7.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;12-create-only-cards-you-actually-plan-to-study&quot;&gt;12. Create only cards you actually plan to study&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t create nonsense cards. Ask yourself if the card will actually help you.
Remember that spaced repetition is an efficient scheduler so going from 5k to 10k cards isn’t 2x more work. It is initially but quickly your spacings increase and you’re going to just be reviewing a few cards per day again.
However, by only keeping important cards in there this helps you avoid card burnout. Reason #1 why people stop using spaced repetition is that the ‘why’ is not there.
The why is because they’re valuable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;13-use-shingling-to-remember-speeches&quot;&gt;13. Use ‘shingling’ to remember speeches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not include entire speeches to remember. Instead. Instead, use overlapping sentences.
For example, if you want to remember the following:
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
Break it out into three cards:
Q: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
A: Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
–
Q: Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
A: We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
–
Q: We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
A: We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
This will help you connect the parts without having to choke on a massive card with the entire speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;14-use-extra-fields&quot;&gt;14. Use extra fields&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create an ‘extra’ field with your cards so that you can add notes and pictures so that when you fail to remember you can get back to the original context.
We’ll often put the book information. The actual text of where I saw the card, etc.
In fact, one of the Polar features we’re working on is to add this directly so when you create a flashcard in Polar it automatically generates a card with the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;15-use-stories-and-etymology&quot;&gt;15. Use stories and etymology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attach ‘extra’ stories to the material but or use imagery to remember the material.
We’ve found that etymology works VERY well for learning languages.
For example. The German word for sea is Meer which is related to the English word marine and mare (Spanish / Italian for sea).
See, now you’re already speaking three languages ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;16-use-cards-to-remember-faces&quot;&gt;16. Use cards to remember faces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of our favorite hacks. Most people have trouble matching faces and names. 
I used to have an excel file with names and any additional information where I met them. Actually adding the picture makes it 10x more powerful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;17-and-finally-dont-fall-for-ankiapp&quot;&gt;17. And finally… don’t fall for AnkiApp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you’re using Anki and not AnkiApp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/2020/02/03/anki-ripped-off.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt; into it here. Anki is the popular open-source platform used by many. AnkiApp is a Chinese rip-off riding the wave of Anki’s popularity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are our Anki tips from years of using it hands-on. Use the above tips to keep moving forward with spaced repetition. Use a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polar&lt;/a&gt; to easily create flashcards and sync them to Anki.
Spaced repetition is tremendously powerful. However, it won’t replace the work of actually understanding the material. This is still your job.

&lt;p&gt;Flashcards have a reputation for being one of the most popular ways of studying and retaining information. They’re also a time-tested tool. Their history dates back to the 19th century when English educator Favell Lee Mortimer used a set of phonics flashcards. Here’s a nice read on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainscape.com/blog/2012/04/history-of-flashcards/&quot;&gt;history of flashcards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, flashcards have come a long way and have been adapted for mobile platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s quite handy to know how to write good flashcards. You can start by mixing pictures and words — imagery helps you recollect experiences a lot better. This is also known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27CsEELSkrw&quot;&gt;Picture Superiority Effect&lt;/a&gt; in cognitive psychology. You can also try to break complex concepts into multiple simpler questions. Making good flashcards goes a long way in learning and retaining new information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple software and mobile app solutions exist to simplify your life when creating flashcards. There’s a reason for that — flashcards significantly improve your learning experience. But with so many options, choosing the best flashcard app can be quite confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People and developers are finding new ways of using flashcard tools. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesector.com.au/2020/02/03/a-21st-century-approach-to-emergent-literacy-no-flashcards-in-preschool-please/&quot;&gt;Some are opposing it&lt;/a&gt; as well, especially in playschools, saying that early learning needs to be creative and challenging. Flashcards have nothing against extensive print learning, they’re a proven way of learning new information. Sometimes the new stuff does not have much of a creative approach to it, as in the case of the many medical terminologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, flashcards can be fun. The add-ons for Anki have made them more engaging and interactive, where they are more than just binary. Their integrations to document managers such as Polar have also proved how they can be effectively integrated to find more applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, flashcards are particularly powerful when coupled with other learning methods. In particular, association or absurd and ridiculous imagery can help tremendously in retaining information on flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Must-have Anki Add-ons for Medical Students in 2020</title><link href="https://getpolarized.io/2020/02/14/Must-have-Anki-Add-ons-for-Medical-Students-in-2020.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Must-have Anki Add-ons for Medical Students in 2020" /><published>2020-02-14T09:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-02-14T09:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://getpolarized.io/2020/02/14/Must-have-Anki-Add-ons-for-Medical-Students-in-2020</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://getpolarized.io/2020/02/14/Must-have-Anki-Add-ons-for-Medical-Students-in-2020.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;must-have-anki-add-ons-for-medical-students-in-2020&quot;&gt;Must-have Anki Add-ons for Medical Students in 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know med school is tough and the amount of information required to memorize is tremendous. So obviously the question begs why not make it easy on yourself and use some powerful tools?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anki is an open source flashcard software. If you’re here, you likely know how popular it is among med school students. Since it’s open source, anyone can build on top of it. So we decided to compile a list of most popular add-ons we heard from &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot;&gt;our users&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/knT-rTG6qdw8OlKZUIijJm2_r2d6-tB3_Dop0AouIW9WUmaFCvsSAxL-b1uqpjxppt1ubnVVqwjobPGfU2qaGZpho1w8YEESLBd2OS_c6AXinYz-YBdO97q9nxR--KXLrOec4sq_&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the free add-ons on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/2.1&quot;&gt;Anki website&lt;/a&gt; to improve your Anki experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of add-ons by other Anki users. With every Anki update, more functionality is added, especially through support of more add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have categorized these Anki add-ons to make it easy to find what you are looking for. While these Anki add-ons are great for med students, they can be used by other students or casual learners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid border&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hpJLma7qa1jb98a0y_AUdwsW7HCVio2-82yd6FYOj3VbyKU3aYMuT1xZWLDTwBGUJe7kOUio5s-YPoHbUr1WxSbM462fFWj6qHyVswBpK6dI1G71iGRVTk6rRMuMdgK-cbWVcg6v&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install an Anki add-on, go to the tools menu and then Add-ons, then click on Browse &amp;amp; Install and paste in the code. Here’s also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saVJN5-_JDM&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; that explains this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: The Pokemanki add-on will keep you motivated to use Anki by letting you catch and train Pokemons inside your deck. It gives you a hatchable Pokemon egg for each lowest-level deck that you start learning. Your Pokemon will keep on leveling up as you review and learn the cards in the deck. They might even evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access your Pokemons under your Stats screen. They will be above all your figures and charts. You will be able to see Pokemons for specific decks and their origin. Just review the deck to keep on training them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: Kittens rule the internet, and they have taken over Anki decks as well. Kitten Rewards is an Anki add-on which acts as an excellent learning motivator. This add-on has a simple concept: it adds a “cute kitten” on the congrats screen after a deck is finished. So if you lack motivation to study, use this add-on to get back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more? You can upload your own kitten pictures as well :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: Anki fanfare is another cool add-on if you want to add a particular theme to your flashcard review. For example, there’s a trout theme and a Bruce Lee theme. The trout theme shows pictures of trout, and the Bruce Lee theme shows you sayings from the Master. Be like water?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has so many themes that you can use with your cards. Simply download a particular theme and unzip it to “fanfare/user_files”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users have reviewed this add-on writing that they get a “dopamine hit” every time they finish a card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: A little RPG magic always does the trick. No, we are not talking about Skyrim — you might never do any learning around Skyrim. But this little RPG integrated into the Anki software can take you a long way when it comes to finding a little motivation while reviewing those cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anki Habitat is supported across platforms. It works by adding points to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://habitica.com/static/home&quot;&gt;Habitica stats&lt;/a&gt; as you progress through your cards. With these points added to your Habitica character, you can battle your friends and slay monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a really cool add-on if you already use Habitica. If not, give it a try and motivate yourself to achieve your goals. Over 2,000,000 people are having fun through Habitica while achieving their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popularity: Very popular (383 upvotes - I mean, seriously, who doesn’t love night mode?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: The history of night modes can be traced back to Windows Phone 7. The feature was added to the now-dead OS to reduce battery consumption as entirely black pixels didn’t emit any light on OLED screens. Since then, night mode as a feature in apps and software has come a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s one the best Anki add-ons for medical students as they can recharge their deck review (even at night) by modifying Anki to having an all-black background. The add-on gives you the option to automatically (timer) or manually turn on the night mode. You can even invert colors of images or latex formulas and define custom color substitution rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: If you need some rigorous learning done through Anki, then you might as well use some colors. You must know that the Anki’s deck page has buttons defined as ‘Good’, ‘Easy’, and ‘Again’ to update the time between iterations on a card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This add-on only imitates the impact of colors on humans: red is known to pose a bit of danger, and you are good to go when things are green. This add-on makes the “Good” button green and the “Again” button red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m a simple man. I see colours, I click like.” — add-on review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: Medical studies require a high amount of focus. There are so many new terms coming in, and you wouldn’t want to entertain any distractions as you try to get through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This add-on does what it says — it adds F11 key binding so that you can toggle full screen on Anki. You can also find this feature in the Tools menu. With this add-on at hand, you can cast all the distractions aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: The Keyboards Shortcuts add-on is designed to increase your efficiency on the Anki app. It allows you to change the shortcuts on the main page, the editor window, the review window, and the deck browser window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can head over to Tools &amp;gt; Add-ons&amp;gt; Custom Shortcuts and click Config to change each shortcut inside Anki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: The whole point of Anki is to make memorization more efficient. Now imagine this: you plan out your cards, add images, and at the review time, you realize that the pictures are too small or big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the ImageResizer add-on, you can resize all the images to the desired format and make sure that the image size is not a problem anymore. To change the shortcut and the size of the photos you are using, click on Tools, and then go to ImageResizer. The add-on page has a great tutorial to figure out exactly how to use this add-on to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: Have you ever had to remember body parts from an image? Probably… :) A quick and effective way to remember these names is by hiding parts of an image in your card and then testing your knowledge of that hidden information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Occlusion Enhanced Addon is designed to do just that. You can use it to memorize things better by hiding labels in a diagram, and then revealing them. The cards generated under this add-on are described as ‘mage-based cloze-deletions’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s even a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MozITKTz5YFHDGB19ypxcYfJ1ITk_6o&quot;&gt;video tutorials&lt;/a&gt; on how to use the add-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: Wouldn’t it be great if you can batch download pictures to Anki through an add-on so that you can later use them in your cards? This add-on for Anki downloads pictures from Google Images into a destination field. You also get to select how many pictures to download and choose the maximum height and width for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The add-on is fast and takes about 3 seconds to download a picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: Web browsers can be a distraction. You sit with Anki open on your computer, and next thing you know, you are browsing memes on Reddit ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This add-on prevents you from opening your computer’s web browser by installing a native browser to Anki. It has a simple browser that lets you search words on the internet and then later import the information to your card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: While studying, it’s always great to track your progress. Anki does come with some stats that you can look at, but the Review Heatmap add-on gives you an advanced tracking functionality. It’s a great Anki plugin for med students as it shows you your daily review averages, days learned, current streak, and longest streak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newest release for Anki 2.1 is still in Beta, and you can download it from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap/releases&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This Anki plugin also integrates well with the Night Mode add-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anki code: Suggested download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap/releases/tag/v0.7.0-beta.1&quot;&gt;beta page on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you have it folks. These Anki add-ons for medical students can save you valuable time and totally redefine the way you use Anki to learn and retain new information. Most of these plugins come with great support and documentation to make their usage as easy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have other add-ons you think med students should use, do let us know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Must-have Anki Add-ons for Medical Students in 2020</summary></entry></feed>
