It’s likely the confusion stemmed from the similar...

Among these was a pretty large refactor into a ‘monorepo’ using submodules to make Polar much easier to...

Web capture (or just capture) is what we call converting an HTML page to a format that can be persisted and used within Polar. This code started off as an advanced proof of concept but it had a few issues in practice that holds it back from perfectly solving the problem of...

          Features in Polar 1.8.0 Transcript Below Sorry about the transcript formatting. I'm going to have to figure out a better long term solution here. I wanted to discuss what was going into polar 1.8 which we just shipped (I think a couple days ago( and there's some really cool features in here and unfortunately I didn't get a chance to create this video when we cut the release so I'm probably gonna do a 1.8.1...

          Over 500 Top PDFs posted to Hacker News in 2018 Hacker News is a GREAT source of tech news but one of the things I really like about it is when insanely smart people post actual PDFs they've found. In the past I've seen PDFs from text books, brilliant original research and even old trusted technical books from the 80s and 90s. So I figured it would be interesting to compute the top PDFs from...

          The EU Plan S for Open Access to Scientific Research The EU and China have an ambitious new plan to provide open access (OA) for scientific papers: Since the September 2018 launch of the Europe-backed program to mandate immediate open access (OA) to scientific literature, 16 funders in 13 countries have signed on. That’s still far shy of Plan S’s ambition: to convince the world’s major research funders to require immediate OA to all published...

Polar is a personal knowledge repository for your books, PDFs, and web content which supports annotation including highlights and comments. Having this data available across all your computers is insanely helpful. Our users wanted the ability to sync their reading and annotations across computers with the option for...
