# Roadmap

We try to keep an active roadmap published on some high level features that we're working on in the background.

Most of these issues are also in our Github issue tracker but since some of these will take weeks or months to implement
we like to keep track of them here.

**Last Updated**: Nov 14, 2019

## EPUB 

We're working on implementing the EPUB file format in the background.  It requires a significant amount of work in the
viewer though and will take a while to finish up.

## Browser-based Web Capture

We're porting web capture to function entirely within our web extension.  This will mean that features like ad blocking
will work with capture.
