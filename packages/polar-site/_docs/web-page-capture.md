# Web Page Capture

Polar supports long term web page archival via a process called “capture” which downloads and caches the content locally. We store it in Polar as if it were any other type of document (like PDF or epub).
This allows you to manage web pages with tags and annotations including text and area highlights, comments, and flashcards. This essentially allows Polar to work as your own personal Internet archive for documents critical to your education. One issue with annotating documents on the web is that the author might change the document (or even delete it) thereby invalidating your annotations. Polar prevents that by capturing the content in the cloud for your own long term usage.

## Link Rot
 
Capture prevents the problem of “link rot” where URLs vanish from the web over time due to a natural form of attribution. Either the domain expires or the content is deleted or the location changed.
 
 
The <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2018/10/01/more-than-9-million-broken-links-on-wikipedia-are-now-rescued/">Internet Archive</a> has found that more than 9M URLs on Wikipedia return 404 error pages.
 
With Polar, you never have to worry about this being an issue as you have a permanent long term copy of important content.
 
## Chrome Extension

The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-polar/jkfdkjomocoaljglgddnmhcbolldcafd" target="_blank">Polar Chrome Extension</a> allows you to send webpages directly from Chrome into Polar. To save a page, just click on the Polar button in the toolbar. Upon clicking, the webpage will be converted into an easier-to-read format with a ‘Save to Polar’ button at the top right corner. Click it to add the page to your repository.
 
## Document Repository

After the web page is captured and saved locally, it’s saved to the document repository where you can reference it at any time in the future.

**Adding tags**

To add tags to your documents in Polar, press the tag symbol (or press t) just right of the progress tracking bar.

Furthermore, the document repository supports features like tracking reading progress and custom sorting (by updated time, added time).
