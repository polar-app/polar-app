# Overview

We take support very seriously.  If you have an issue please reach out so we can resolve it.    

# Github Issues

You can submit an [issue directly to Github](https://github.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/issues)

# Errors

If you're having issues with Polar please go to Help (```?``` button at the top right) and then go to ```Logs```.

Copy these and then send a report ticket to the email from ```Help``` | ```Support``` or support __at__ getpolarized dot io.

We're going to work on an automated way to submit these in the future and include a tracking ticket.
