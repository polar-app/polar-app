# Sharing and Collaboration

Polar supports sharing files with other users and commenting and sharing annotations and comments allow you to 
collaborate with groups.  

In order to share a document open the document and click on the 'share' button in the sidebar.

At this point a new dialog will open up.  Enter the users email to invite them to the document.

You should use their primary Polar email address.

They will then receive a popup notification and they can add the document locally.

At that point all annotations will be shared on the sidebar with each invited user who has added the document.
