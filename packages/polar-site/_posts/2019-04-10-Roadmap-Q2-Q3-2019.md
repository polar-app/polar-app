# Polar Roadmap for Q2 and Q3 2019

I wanted to write up a quick blog post for the features I'd like to see in 
Q2 and Q3 2019 for you guys to review. 

## Q2 2019

- Initial version of sharing.  Single document only with public URL (public or private only)

- Area highlights with support for annotations and storing them as screenshots along with the document as binary attachments.

- Advanced sharing with teams and user to user + groups a month later

- Mobile PWA supported to use Polar on iOS and Android

- Polar bundled in app stores directly

- Native Flashcard support without having to need Anki

- Support for bibliographic information stored in Polar for scientific usage

- Full team sharing / collaboration including protected documents across teams and realtime collaboration.

- Firefox extension support

- Web app out of preview (and fast!)

- More colors for highlights

- Binary attachments required for area highlights

- Actively engage the user to encourage reading progress via integrated reading tracking (partially implemented today)

- Webpack refactor to make our app much smaller <1MB download size on mobile

- Comments + Notes + Flashcards directly on the document

- New annotation bar so that user can add comments and flashcards without having to use the sidebar.

- Thumbnails for documents

- All CSS embedded in thin web archives.

- Initial UI / UX re-design 

- Better key bindings along with documentation
                                                                   
- Latex (math) in comments and flashcards

- DOI lookup provided by unpaywall API.

- Extended metadata support with metadata 'profiles' so that they can be merged

- Search documents on arxiv and import automatically

- Bulk import from directories recursively on install

- New icon / logo
                
- More documentation improvements

- Figure out a solution + UI for hierarchical tags. Many users have requested
  this and I think we can do this via our normal tag mechanism and just need to 
  figure out how to fix the UI for this to handle it properly.
  
- Comments and annotations should themselves support tags not just inherit the 
  tag for the book with which they're associated.
                                                                   
## Q3 2019

- New document viewer which supports ePub, and Mobi document formats

- Dark mode implemented once we're on a new document viewer.

- Full-text search in cloud but possibly in the standlone desktop version as well 

- Plugin API for desktop applications

- Basic REST API for local desktop app for basic operations such as adding files and updating metadata for integration with 3rd party apps.

- Active Capture where the chrome extension automatically saves content while you browse.

- Web annotations without having to capture documents offline but support documents 
  which are just URLs references stored in polar.

- Capture directly within the browser using the chrome extension which won't  require the desktop app.

- Annotations attached to shingles not based on absolute positioning.  Right now
our annotation model positions an annotation at a specific place in on the page
at an x,y coordinate offset.  This won't work with fluid web layout or normal 
web pages and possibly not with ePub so we need a system based on position the 
annotations around text.

- Import from Pocket, Zotero, Mendeley (if possible), Evernote.

- Distributed and real-time annotations with federation when using document sharing.

- Usability improvements to document viewer thanks to new architecture.
 
- Support for note taking without having to have a document backing the note.
 
- Support for feeds of content and edge aggregated data streams similar to RSS feeds

- Support for thin and fat captures with web archives. Right now we support thin
content with just the CSS but we should also support images as well.

- Tabbed browsing for desktop edition.

- More documentation improvements
                                                                   
## Q4 2019

- Rest API using OpenID to authenticate with the webapp and provide access to a 
users data with 3rd party APIs.
