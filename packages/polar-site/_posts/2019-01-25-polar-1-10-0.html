<p>
    The 1.10 release focuses on a number of medium-scale
    features but also improves stability across the board.
</p>

<h2>Updated UI</h2>

<p>
    The most obvious feature is that the UI has been
    significantly updated to support a new fixed header bar
    bar.
</p>

<p>
    One of the motivations for this was that users were
    getting confused when using the app for the first time
    and didn't know how to add content.  Now there's a
    large '+ Add' button front and center which is a clear
    call to action.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, the added space allows for selecting multiple
    items.
</p>

<h2>Tagging Multiple Items</h2>

<p>
    You can now tag multiple items in the UI by holding
    down shift (or control) and then clicking on the items
    you want to modify.
</p>

<p>
    Shift allows you to select a range and control allows
    you to select one at a time.
</p>

<p>
    At the top left a new 'tag' button will pop up and you
    can then assign tags to multiple documents at once.
    This is very handy for new users that want to bulk-tag
    multiple documents.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, you can now sort by tags and if you hit the
    'tags' column header at the top, twice, you can see
    untagged documents and then tag them in bulk.
</p>

<p>
    This can be used when importing a large number of documents
    at once that all have the same tags.
</p>

<h2>New Exporter Framework</h2>

<p>
    Many users requested the ability to easily export
    annotations from Polar and we've shipped an initial
    implementation of exporting content.
</p>

<p>
    Note that you have always had the ability to export the
    raw content in JSON form but this is designed to make
    exports more usable.
</p>

<p>
    In the annotation sidebar there's a new button for
    'Export' which allows you to write the annotations to
    JSON or Markdown.
</p>

<p>
    Right now it only supports writing to a file but we're
    also going to implement support for writing to the
    clipboard as HTML format for easily posting your
    annotations to your blog, Twitter, etc.
</p>

<p>
    The plan is to enable exporting in the 'annotation'
    view which would allow you to export all your annotations
    based any filters you define.  This would allow you
    to preview the annotations and then export them in bulk
    without having to open up a specific document.
</p>

<h2>Changelog:</h2>

    </li>

    <li>
        Bug: Fixed (I hope) long standing ugly bug of 'crash' of Electron on app exit due
        to windows not being destroyed via destroy().  Close does not release the
        resources properly.
    </li>

    <li>
        Bug: Fixed bug where long titles in URLs could generate filenames that were too
        long and couldn't be represented on the filesystem.  We not truncate at 50
        chars.
    </li>

    <li>
        Feature: New buttons for '+ Add' to import from disk or capture web page.
        Much easier to determine how to add content to polar.

    </li>

    <li>
        Feature: Sorting by tags is now much better and actually works.  If you double
        click the sort column it will show you untagged documents sorted by the time
        they were added.
    </li>

    <li>
        Dependencies: Update to electron 3.1.1
    </li>

    </li>


</ul>
