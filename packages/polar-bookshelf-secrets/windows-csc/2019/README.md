This entire process via Sectigo/Comodo is a nightmare.

Probably DO NOT use them again.

The key is that you have to get a STANDARD VALIDATION cert.

Then you have to make sure you generate the cert FROM SAFARI including ISSUE the cert.

Then you need to download the certs. open it and added it to the key chain and then export it to .p12 format with 
no password.
