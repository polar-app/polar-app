 * PDF pagemarks are placed by the pageNumber and 'rect' which specifies whic
 * part of the page is covered.
 *
 * When you want to create multiple pagemarks you create one for each page.
 *
 * EPUB:
 *
 * EPUBs pagemarks are a bit different as EPUBs are fluid so they're anchored
 * to one of the two strategies.
 *
 * - Entire page covered is just a pagemark on the give page with percentage as
 *   100.  This is normally used for ranges so that we don't have to lookup
 *   all the EPUB CFIs on those pages which would take time.
 *
 * - With 'anchors' that specify the start and end of the pagemark with an
 *   EPUB CFI and a 'percentage' of the page covered for tracking in the UI.
