/**
 * A AnnotationRect is a basic Rect for representing an annotation on a page.
 *
 * This is a box layout for an annotation.  We use the typical DOM positioning
 * style of top, left, width and height only instead of percentages we represent
 * this as percentage of the entire 'page'.
 *
 * This would represent the range within a page that a box covers.  This is
 * essentially a range has a start and end which are percentages of the page that
 * a rect covers but in two dimensions (not just one).
 *
 * A default rect (for the entire page) would have a value of:
 *
 * { top: 0, left: 0, width: 100, height: 100 }
 *
 * A range for a page that is half way completed is [0,50]
 *
 * { top: 0, left: 0, width: 100, height: 50 }
 *
 * We also provide additional functionality where we can start the rect
 * other than at the top of the page. For example, if you wanted to mark the
 * bottom 50% of the page as read, you could create the rect as:
 *
 * { top: 50, left: 0, width: 100, height: 50 }
 *
 * The user can create rect at any point and then we create a small rect
 * anchored to that spot, and give it a bit of height so that the user can
 * visually see it.
 *
 * Note that the percentage are of the available width and height.  The normal
 * ratio we use is 8.5x11 but width and height as percentages would be 100x100.
 *
 * This would NOT be a square but a rectangle and the percentages confuse that.
