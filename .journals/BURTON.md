Trying to determine where to resume my coding. I think I can have the DOM 
string search code working soon and also use JSDOM to test this without having
to use the browser.

## placing highlights in HTML

This has some sample code for working with highlights by showing them in the UI 
directly with minimal DOM interaction.

## search within DOM

this is some example code that allows us to search within a DOM for text.  We
should port this to JSDOM within Polar so that I can make it work in production.

## new package

.. created new package **polar-dom-text-search**

# PREHISTORY

- We have a new EPUBViewer that basically can RENDER to a single page but we 
  have to dramatically improve it to make it work in production.
